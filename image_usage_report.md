## Recommendations

1. **Review Before Deletion**: The 362 unused images in `final_unused_images_no_icons.txt` appear to be safe for cleanup, but review a sample to confirm.

2. **Focus on /images/ Directory**: 360 of the 362 unused images are in `static/images/` - start cleanup here.

3. **Safe to Keep**:

   - All 92 files in `static/icons/` (as requested)
   - All files in `static/img/` are being used except 2

4. **Create Backup**: Before deletion, backup the unused images in case any are needed later.

5. **Monitor After Cleanup**: Watch for any broken references after removing unused files.

## Next Steps

1. Review `final_unused_images_no_icons.txt` for any files you want to keep
2. Create a backup of images to be deleted
3. Remove unused images from `static/images/` directory
4. Test the site to ensure no broken references
5. Consider implementing image management processes for the future

## Methodology Notes

This comprehensive analysis scanned:

- All `.md` and `.mdx` files in `/docs` directory for image references
- All `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx` files in `/src` directory for image imports/references
- `docusaurus.config.js` for favicon, logo, and other configured images
- Combined and deduplicated all references for final accuracy

The analysis properly handles various image reference formats including relative paths, absolute paths, and @site/static/ imports.
