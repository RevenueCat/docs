      <div>This is a documentation of the External Purchases API, which is currently in private beta.</div>
    </div>
    What is the External Purchases API? When to use it?

    ## Context

    The External Purchases API enables you to track subscription status and revenue data from Payment Service Providers that RevenueCat doesn't support natively. Such examples of Payment Service Providers, referenced as _External Sources_, are Paddle, PayPal, Braintree, Adyen, Recurly, etc.

    You can post subscription status and payment events to the External Purchases API to use RevenueCat as a single source of truth for providing access to your application across mobile and web and to consolidate revenue data and key subscription metrics. Customer history, Webhooks and Integration events are supported as well, but they have [limitations](#tag/Beta-Limitations) during the Beta period.

    The API expects data to be posted in a format defined in the [API reference](#tag/External-Purchases), meaning that you would need to convert or transform data from the _External Source_ before posting it to the External Purchases API endpoint. RevenueCat accepts data posted to this endpoint as is, and relies on your timely requests to provide entitlement access.

    If you have a mobile first business with a web presence that follows a similar monetization model and subscription lifecycle implementation typical to the app stores, then this API is the right choice for you to consolidate your stack.

    ## Adding an External Source

    You can add an External Source under _Project > Apps > +New_. All you need to provide is the App name. The External API Keys and RevenueCat App ID required to call the API are automatically generated after hitting _Save Changes_.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/adding-external-app.png)

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/external-app-settings.png)


    ## Authentication

    Authentication for the External Purchases API is achieved by setting the `Authorization` header with a valid API secret external key. You'll find two main types of API keys in your RevenueCat dashboard: _public app-specific_ , _secret_ and _secret app-specific_.

    ```Text Authorization Header
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REVENUECAT_APP_SPECIFIC_SECRET_API_KEY
    ```

    The API keys are automatically generated for each External Source whenever you add a new _External Source_ on the _Add New App_ screen in the Dashboard.

    You can retrieve these API keys both on the _Apps settings_ page and _Project settings > API Keys_ page.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/external-secret-api-keys.png)

    ## Permissions

    You can call the External Purchases API only with the corresponding _app-specific Secret API key_.
    The _app-specific Secret API Key_ should be kept out of any publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client side code.
    Additionally, an _app-specific Public API Key_ is generated so public endpoints like [Offerings](/docs/api-v1#tag/offerings/operation/get-offerings) can be accessed.

    # Base URL

    The base URL for the External Purchases API is `https://api.revenuecat.com/`.

    # Endpoints

    The API has one endpoint, `POST/receipts/external`.

    `POST/receipts/external` is used for requests with a single purchase and/or payment, and processes them right away. Calling [Get Customer](/docs/api-v1#tag/customers/operation/subscribers) right after will return the updated entitlements.

    For more details check the [API reference](#operation/track-external-purchases).

    ## Payload

    The body of the `POST` requests should be encoded in JSON and have the 'Content-Type' header set to 'application/json'.

    ```Text Content-Type Header
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```

    ```json Sample body
    {
      "purchase": {
        "object": "external_subscription",

- name: Example Subscription Lifecycle
  x-traitTag: true
  description: |
    This example of a subscription lifecycle demonstrates the series of API request to make to the External Purchases API and the resulting events generated (for Customer History, Webhooks and Integration Events).

    This flow covers a Trial Flow with Successful Conversion, an ordinary Subscription Renewal, a Billing Issue Flow that gets resolved in Grace Period, and eventually a Cancellation Flow.

    ## Sample API requests

    ### Trial purchase
    ```json Trial purchase

    ## Backfill new transaction in the subscription

    If subscription statuses arrive out of order (eg. RevenueCat receives a previous subscription period before a subsequent subscription period), RevenueCat needs to make a decision about how the history of the subscription looked like. This section describes various scenarios that can occur.

    ### Context

    We know that the new transaction ends before the latest old one.

    ### Overall Scenario

    The transaction can fit everywhere between or overlap the existing transactions.  The new transaction can be in any of the following positions.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/36e8e3a-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_11.33.29.png)


    We need to find the previous and next overlapping transactions if any.

    #### Scenario 1

    Both previous and next overlapping old transactions exist. As a result, we shrink the previous old transaction to end right before the new one. Similarly, we shrink the new transaction to end right before the next old one.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/ab6705e-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_11.38.02.png)


    #### Scenario 2

    Only the previous overlapping old transaction exist. As a result, we shrink the prev transaction to end right before the new one. The new transaction is not changed.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/acee024-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_11.39.12.png)


    #### Scenario 3

    Only the next overlapping old transaction exist. As a result, we shrink the new transaction to end right before the next old one.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/670069c-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_11.40.13.png)


    #### Scenario 4

    There’s no old transaction overlapping with the new one. As a result, we just store the new transaction as is.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/9e1c7f6-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.56.05.png)


    #### Scenario 5

    The new transaction overlaps completely a old one (prev). As a result, we send ERROR, the new transaction is skipped.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/f3b21e7-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_12.56.52.png)


    ### Move back the latest_expiring_transaction start date if needed

    ### Context

    We know that the new transaction ends after the latest old one.

    #### Scenario 1

    Old transaction starts before and ends during new one. As a result, we shrink the old transaction to end right before the new one

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/0839207-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_13.00.01.png)


    #### Scenario 2

    Old transaction starts and ends during new one. As a result, we send ERROR, the new transaction is skipped.

    ![](/docs/images/external-purchases-api/88623c8-Screenshot_2023-08-08_at_13.01.06.png)


    #### Scenario 3

    Old transaction starts and ends before the  new one. As a result, the new transaction is saved, the old one is not modified.

- name: Beta Limitations
  x-traitTag: true
  description: |
    The following limitations apply during Beta period:

    1. For `purchase` JSON with `external_subscription` object:
        1. Currently you cannot change the `customer_id` field, meaning that we don't support [Transferring purchases seen on multiple App User IDs](/getting-started/restoring-purchases#transferring-purchases-seen-on-multiple-app-user-ids)
        2. We don't generate a new event in a scenario, when `current_period_ends_at` was in the future, and it's changed to a different future date.
        3. We support the following options for the `auto_renew_status` field:  `will_renew`, `will_not_renew`, `unknown` value. We omit the `will_change_product` for now, meaning that we don't support Upgrades, Downgrade, Crossgrades and resulting event (`PRODUCT_CHANGE` event).
        4. Family shared subscriptions are not supported (but you can still create shared subscriptions as regular subscriptions).
    2. In a scenario when payments are posted after a subscription or purchase was created we don't generate Events (since the revenue information was already sent with the `INITIAL_PURCHASE` / `RENEWAL` event)
    3. Receipt validation:
        1. Currently, we do not validate receipts or data posted to RevenueCat via the External purchases API. Customers must ensure that data posted to the endpoint is already validated, and they need to ensure that the External API Key is not getting exposed to the public.
    4. Refunds:
        1. In the scenario when the third party payment service provider retains commissions in case of a refund, Revenuecat does not track negative revenues. Meaning, that in such cases, you will see data discrepancies with the equivalent of the commission retained by the payment service provider.
    5. Entitlement identifier:
        1. We support only new entitlement identifiers ([not the legacy version](/docs/integrations/webhooks/event-types-and-fields#subscription-lifecycle-events-fields)).
    6. [Backfills](#tag/Backfill-Logic) that modify `current_period_ends_at` date, do not alter existing Events, which means that the Customer history won't reflect accurately the most up to date `expiration_at_ms`.
    7. If a different `source_subscription_identifier` gets provided, doesn’t matter if it’s the same product, we can end up with concurrent transactions
    8. `EXPIRATION` Events are not fired automatically. The developer needs to explicitly send a request to the External Purchases API endpoint when `status` changed to `expired`.
