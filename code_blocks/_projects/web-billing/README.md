# Web Billing docs code snippets

This folder contains the Web Billing code snippets for the docs in the file `web-billing-doc-snippets.ts`. Each snippet is contained in a region that starts with `// MARK {identifier}` and ends with `// END`. Snippets are then extracted by passing a `region` parameter to the tab of the `RCCodeBlock` in the documentation, like this:

```
import webBillingContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/_projects/web-billing/web-billing-doc-snippets.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: webBillingContent, name: "Web (JS/TS)" , region: "Configuring SDK"},
]} />
```

## Testing code snippets

The above approach allows testing the code snippets. To test the code snippets, go into the folder and install the dependencies by using

```
npm install
```

If there has been an update to the `purchases-js` package, you might have to run

```
npm install @revenuecat/purchases-js@latest
```

To run the tests, run the following command:

```
npm run test
```

### Known limitations

Right now, the tests mostly test the functionality of getting offerings and product details. The purchasing test only tests that the purchase method is called, it doesn't actually make a purchase â€“ the problem here is that to do that we would need to use Puppeteer or something similar to create a browser environment.

## Adding code snippets

When adding a new code snippet, please also add tests in the file `web-billing-doc-snippets.test.ts`. You can have a look at the example tests to get inspiration.
