title: Finishing Transactions (formerly Observer Mode)
slug: observer-mode
excerpt: Using RevenueCat without changing existing purchase code
hidden: false
---

Finishing transactions tells the device billing library that a purchase has been processed and can be discarded. RevenueCat does this by default, however, this may interfere with pre-existing purchase handling code in your app. By disabling transaction finishing in RevenueCat's SDK, you can still make use of many of RevenueCat's features, without replacing your existing purchase handling code.

Some features may be degraded or unavailable if RevenueCat is not finishing transactions.

_\*\* Entitlement tracking will function even if transactions are finished by pre-existing purchase code, however it may introduce race conditions and caution should be used _

### Implementation

#### 1. Configure the SDK

// TODO: Add code blocks
import om2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/migrating-to-revenuecat/observer-mode_2.m";
import om4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/migrating-to-revenuecat/observer-mode_4.java";
import om5 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/migrating-to-revenuecat/observer-mode_5.dart";
import om6 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/migrating-to-revenuecat/observer-mode_6.cs";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'objc',
        content: om2,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        content: om4,
    },
    {
        type: 'dart',
        content: om5,
    },
    {
        type: 'unity',
        content: om6,
    },
]}/>

##### Enable Observer Mode in Unity Editor (Unity Only)

###### For Google Play (can also be done programmatically, see Configuration section)

###### For Amazon Store (can also be done programmatically, see Configuration section)

:::warning Important note regarding InAppBillingService (Android Unity only)
If using RevenueCat alongside Unity IAP or other plugin that includes the Android InAppBillingService class, follow [these instructions ](/getting-started/installation/unity#installation-with-unity-iap-side-by-side)
:::

:::danger Important (Android only)
On Android, RevenueCat **will not** consume or acknowledge any purchase in Observer Mode so be sure your app is handling that. **Failure to do so will result in your purchases being refunded after 3 days.**
:::


#### 2. Sync purchases with RevenueCat (Amazon Store only)

On Android with Amazon Store (including cross-platform SDKs running on Android), any time a purchase or restore occurs in your app you should call the `syncObserverModeAmazonPurchase` method to record it in RevenueCat. **Failure to do so will result in no purchases being recorded**.

import om7 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/migrating-to-revenuecat/observer-mode_7.cs";
import om8 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/migrating-to-revenuecat/observer-mode_8.kt";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'unity',
        content: om7,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        content: om8,
    },
]}/>


## Configuring Integrations

Certain integrations, such as most of the [Attribution Integrations](/integrations/attribution), require some device data to work properly. **Observer Mode does not automatically collect any device data**.

If you plan on using an integration that requires device data with Observer Mode, you'll need to integrate the RevenueCat SDK to collect the data or set the appropriate attributes via the [REST API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference/update-subscriber-attributes). Note that attributes can be passed as an object in the [POST /receipts endpoint](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference/receipts) as well if you're doing a server-side Observer Mode implementation.

## Next Steps

- With Observer Mode up-and-running capturing new purchases, you may want to [migrate existing purchases to RevenueCat as well ](/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions)
