excerpt: Using RevenueCat without changing existing purchase code

---

If you already have your own in-app purchase handling logic in your app and want to start using RevenueCat alongside it, you might need to tell the SDK that your app will **complete the transactions itself**. Completing a transaction tells the device billing library that a purchase has been processed and can be discarded. RevenueCat does this by default, however, this may interfere with pre-existing purchase handling code in your app. 

By telling the RevenueCat SDK that your app's code will complete transactions itself, you can still make use of most of RevenueCat's features, without replacing your existing purchase handling code.

:::info Observer mode
The setting that your app will complete transactions was previously called "observer mode". Old versions of the SDK still refer to this terminology.
