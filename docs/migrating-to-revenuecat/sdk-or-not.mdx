If you have an existing app with in-app purchases and you want to use RevenueCat, you can decide whether or not to implement the RevenueCat SDK. For new apps, or existing apps that have not yet implemented in-app purchases, we recommend integrating the SDK for access to all RevenueCat features and the most seamless experience. 

To start with RevenueCat with an app that already supports in-app purchases, you can use the following information to determine whether you should implement one of our Mobile or Web SDKs:

## Integrating with our SDK

If you want to make use of RevenueCat to streamline your purchasing logic, remotely control and test paywalls, pricing and packaging, or deliver targeted offers to customers, you will need to **integrate one of our [SDKs](/getting-started/installation)**. Integrating the SDK requires shipping an updated version of your mobile or web app.

The following RevenueCat features *require an SDK to be integrated*:
* [Remotely configuring your product catalog](/getting-started/entitlements)
* Remotely configuring [paywall templates](/tools/paywalls) and [other aspects of your app](/tools/offering-metadata)
* [Experiments](/tools/experiments-v1) to A/B test pricing, packaging, and other monetization related aspects of your app
* [Targeting](/tools/targeting) different segments of customers with specific offerings
* [Apple Search Ads attribution](/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads)
* [Replacing your in-app purchase logic with RevenueCat](/getting-started/quickstart#4-using-revenuecats-purchases-sdk) to reduce ongoing engineering effort

:::info Using the RevenueCat SDK alongside your existing logic
If you have existing code to handle in-app purchases and you want to start using some RevenueCat features but not replace all of your existing code, you can always use RevenueCat alongside your existing code and selectively use RevenueCat features.

## Integrating without using the SDK

If you are planning on using RevenueCat mostly to collect and analyze accurate and actionable purchase data, you may choose a **server-side integration**. The following RevenueCat features work *without implementing the SDK*:
* [Charts](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts)
* [Customer history](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history)
* [Customer lists](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-lists)
* [Purchase lifecycle events](/integrations/integrations), [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks), and [integrations with third party tools](/integrations/third-party-integrations)
* [Scheduled data exports](/integrations/scheduled-data-exports) to your data warehouse
* [Checking customer entitlements via the REST API](/customers/customer-info#getting-subscription-status-via-the-rest-api)

You can always start with a server-side integration without the SDK, and add the SDK later. In the case where purchases are made through the SDK and also sent on the server side, RevenueCat will automatically dedupe them, so there is no risk in this approach.
