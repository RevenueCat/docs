# Distributing Web Paywall Links to customers

Once you finalize your setup, you will receive 2 links with the structure: `https://pay.rev.cat/<someProductionTokenWeGenerate>/<yourAppUserId>` — one for production, the other one for sandbox.

To use these links:

- If you're not using [Redemption Links](/web/web-billing/redemption-links) to enable anonymous web purchases, you will need to append a [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) App User ID of the customer you want to be able to subscribe from the link. Without appending the app user ID, **the link will not work**.
- If you're using [Redemption Links](/web/web-billing/redemption-links), you can use the Web Payment Link URLs without appending an App User ID. Anonymous user IDs will be generated until purchases are redeemed in-app.

:::danger Do not send the sandbox URL to customers
The Sandbox URL allows you to test purchases using [Stripe test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#use-test-cards).
Do not distribute this link or whoever will use it will be able to subscribe to your application for free using one
of the Stripe testing cards.

:::warning Use one unique App User ID per customer
Web Billing works with identified customers. You need to specify a unique app user id for each one of the subscribers you
want to reach with this link. You can read more about this requirement [here](/web/web-billing#identifying-customers).

### URL parameters

#### Email

If you already have your customer's email address, use `email` to preset an email address on the payment page: `https://pay.rev.cat/<someProductionTokenWeGenerate>/<yourAppUserId>?email=<customerEmail>`

#### Currency

If you want to specify a currency manually, you can do so by appending the `currency` query parameter to the URL. This will override the automatic currency selection.

:::info
We recommend that all URL parameters are [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) to avoid potential issues.
