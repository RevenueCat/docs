In late April 2025, a U.S. District Court ruling found Apple in violation of a 2021 injunction meant to allow developers to direct users to external payment options, like [Web Billing](/web/web-billing/overview).

As a result, iOS developers are now permitted to guide users to web-based payment flows without additional Apple fees or restrictive design requirements.

## RevenueCat Web Billing

RevenueCat's existing Web Billing solution allows you to easily start selling subscriptions and one-time purchases on the web, and connect them with the same subscriptions and entitlements on mobile. Web Billing is also compatible with [Paywalls v2](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons/).

Get started with Web Billing by following the [setup guide](/web/web-billing/overview).
