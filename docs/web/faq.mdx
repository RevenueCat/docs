Notable updates to external web payments and RevenueCat Web Billing.

## RevenueCat Web Billing

RevenueCat's existing Web Billing solution allows you to easily start selling subscriptions and one-time purchases on the web, and connect them with the same subscriptions and entitlements on mobile. Web Billing is also compatible with [Paywalls v2](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons/).

Get started with Web Billing by following the [setup guide](/web/web-billing/overview).

## 2025 Ruling on External Payment Options

In late April 2025, a U.S. District Court ruling found Apple in violation of a 2021 injunction meant to allow developers to direct users to external payment options, like [Web Billing](/web/web-billing/overview).

As a result, iOS developers are now permitted to guide users to web-based payment flows without additional Apple fees or restrictive design requirements.

## FAQs

### How do I add web payments to my iOS app?

Add a new app in your RevenueCat project and select **Web Billing** as the payment provider. RevenueCat also supports the web payment flow using Web Billing directly in RevenueCat [Paywalls v2](/tools/paywalls).

Read more in [Configuring Web Billing](/web/web-billing/product-setup).

### What does the recent ruling mean for web payments outside of the United States?

This ruling only affects web payments in the United States. The App Store has existing restrictions on web payments outside of the United States.

### Can I remove in-app purchases and exclusively use web payments in my app?

No. As of now, we understand the recent ruling to still require in-app purchases to be available alongside any web payment offers.

### Can I use my existing web checkout with Paywalls v2?

Not yet, we are working on adding support for existing web checkouts with Paywalls v2.

### Can I send a customer directly to the checkout flow for a given product?

Yes, but only if your offering has a single product. We are working on adding support for linking to a specific product in an offering.
