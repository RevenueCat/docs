### Refunding payments
You can refund a one-time purchase made by a customer, or the most recent payment of a customer's subscription.

Refunding returns the funds to the customer's payment method (it can take a few days for the payment to be returned, depending on the payment method and the customer's bank). When a refund is made, the customer immediately loses access to any entitlements associated with their subscription, or purchased item.

:::info No refund for subscriptions with billing issues
For subscriptions where the most recent invoice failed to be collected, you can't refund the payment (since no payment was made). You can still cancel the subscription.
:::

To refund a payment, click into a purchase or renewal event of a subscription in the Customer History:

In the event detail view, you will find the action to refund the payment in the top right corner:
