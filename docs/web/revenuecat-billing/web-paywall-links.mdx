3. Create an [Offering](/tools/offerings-guide) with those Products
4. Visit that Offering's details page and click on the **Web Paywall Link** tab
5. Finally, click on the **Create a Web Paywall Link for this Offering** button

Once you are ready, click Save and your changes will be applied immediately.

:::warning Immediate apply
As soon as you click save, any subscriber visiting your Web Paywall Link will see the changes immediately.

You can always run tests by creating a Web Paywall Link for another offering.
:::

## Sending your Web Paywall Links

Once you finalize your setup you will receive 2 links:
* A production URL that looks like `https://pay.rev.cat/<someProductionTokenWeGenerate>/<yourAppUserId>`
* A sandbox URL that looks like `https://pay.rev.cat/<someSandboxTokenWeGenerate>/<yourAppUserId>`

:::danger Do not send the sandbox URL to customers
The Sandbox URL allows you to test purchases using [Stripe test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#use-test-cards).
Do not distribute this link or whoever will use it will be able to subscribe to your application for free using one
of the Stripe testing cards.
:::

:::warning Use one unique App User ID per customer
RevenueCat Billing works with identified customers. You need to specify a unique app user id for each one of the subscribers you
want to reach with this link.

If you don't add an App User ID to the link it will redirect to https://www.revenuecat.com/.
