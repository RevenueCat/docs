The appearance of certain elements of the Web Billing experience can be customized to match your app's branding. This includes the colors and shapes of certain UI elements.

This customization currently applies to the purchase flow (ie. the UI elements shown when making a purchase from the Web SDK or Web Paywall Links), as well as the Web Paywall Links.

To customize the appearance of the Web Billing experience, go to the App settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and navigate to the **Appearance** tab. You can configure the following options there:

* **Page background**: Used for the background of the page for [Web Paywall Links](/web/revenuecat-billing/web-paywall-links).
* **Product info background**: Used for the panel showing information about the purchased product in the purchase flow.
* **Form background**: Used for the background of the purchase form.
* **Primary Buttons**: The primary color is used for buttons and other interactive elements.
* **Accent**: Used for focused elements as well as some secondary UI elements.
* **Error**: Used for error messages and other negative UI elements.
* **Shapes**: The shape of the purchase modal dialog, buttons, form elements, and package cards in the purchase flow and Web Paywall Links.
* **Show product description in checkout**: If set, the product description will be shown in the product info panel of the purchase flow.
