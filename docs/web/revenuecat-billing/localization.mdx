:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat Billing and the RevenueCat Web SDK are currently in beta.
:::

## Overview

- RevenueCat Billing supports localization for 33 languages in the Web SDK.
- Localization affects the entire purchase flow, including the checkout form (excluding any possible secondary payment flows such as 3D Secure authentication).
- Product names and descriptions are not localized, and will be shown in their original form (as defined in the RevenueCat Dashboard).
- Prices configured through [multi-currency support](/web/revenuecat-billing/multi-currency-support/) are now formatted following the selected locale in the purchase flow.

### Beta limitations
Currently, the following limitations apply while RevenueCat Billing is in beta:
- It is not possible to override any strings for the given languages.
- It is not possible to define a language for us in Web Paywall Links (hosted purchase flow).
- Some of the supported languages may have minor translation issues, and we're working to validate them (please [contact us]("mailto:support@revenuecat.com") with any corrections or general feedback on translations).


## How to use localization support in purchases-js

:::info Web SDK version compatibility
Localization is supported in purchases-js version x.xx and above.
:::

When invoking `purchase()`, you can provide selected and default languages using the `PurchaseParams` interface:

- `selectedLocale` : The locale to use in the purchase flow (if not specified, English will be used)
- `defaultLocale` : The default locale to use if the selectedLocale is not available. This defaults to English.

If you want to fall back to the browser's locale as a default, it's recommended to set `defaultLocale` to the browser locale.
