:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat Billing and the RevenueCat Web SDK are currently in beta.
:::
## Starting a subscription
The process to start a subscription is initiated by calling the [purchase method in the SDK](/getting-started/revenuecat-billing#purchasing-a-package). The subscription starts only if and when the initial payment is confirmed – if the customer cancels the checkout form, or if the initial payment for the subscription fails, no subscription is generated, and no events get generated. 

When the subscription is successfully started, RevenueCat generates an `INITIAL_PURCHASE` [event](/integrations/webhooks/event-types-and-fields). An invoice is then generated and sent to the customer via email, along with a link to the [customer portal](./customer-portal).

## Offers
RevenueCat Billing does not yet support any offers, discounts, or free trials.

## Renewal
RevenueCat will attempt to charge the payment method of a customer not more than 24 hours before the end of the current billing period, if the customer has not canceled their subscription. An invoice is generated for the renewal attempt. 

### Succesful renewal

If the renewal payment is successfully processed, RevenueCat will:
* Generate a `RENEWAL` event.
* Send a renewal confirmation email to the customer, including their invoice and a link to the customer portal.

### Unsuccessful renewal

If the renewal payment couldn't be charged successfully, RevenueCat will:
* Generate a `CANCELLATION` and `BILLING_ISSUE` event.
* Generate an `EXPIRATION` event, unless a grace period has been configured.
* Send a notice of the billing issue to the customer via email, including their invoice and a link to the customer portal to fix their payment method.

The subscription then enters the billing retry period.

#### Billing retry
After a renewal payment has failed, RevenueCat will retry charging the customer's payment method on file for up to 30 days.

#### Grace period
RevenueCat Billing does not yet support setting up a grace period.

#### Billing recovery
If one of the retry attempts is successful, RevenueCat will renew the subscription and generate a `RENEWAL` event. Unless the subscription was still in a grace period, the new billing cycle will start on the date that the payment was succesfully recovered. As an example, consider a monthly subscription started on 1 January, for which the first renewal on 1 February failed, and no grace period was set up. If the payment gets recovered on 10 February, the next billing cycle will run from 10 February to 10 March.


#### Overview of billing retry and recovery
The following image illustrates the timelines and events sent for a successful billing recovery under different circumstances. If the billing retry period ends without being able to recover the payment, no further events get sent, and the subscription remains expired.

## Cancelation
The subscription can be canceled by the customer (via the [customer portal](./customer-portal)) or by the developer (via the [dashboard or API](./managing-customer-subscriptions)). If the subscription is cancelled, RevenueCat will generate a `CANCELLATION` event. The subscription will continue to be active until the end of the current period. At the end of the period, the subscription will expire.

## Refunds
It is currently not possible to refund RevenueCat Billing subscriptions.

## Expiration
A subscription can expire for one of several reasons:
* The subscription has been cancelled and the billing period ended.
* A renewal payment failed and no grace period was set up. Please note that in this case, if payment gets recovered at a later point, the subscription may become active again (and a `RENEWAL` event will be generated).
* A grace period has ended. Please note that in this case, if payment gets recovered at a later point, the subscription may become active again (and a `RENEWAL` event will be generated).
* The subscription was refunded.

In all of these cases, an `EXPIRATION` event is generated.
