:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat Billing and the RevenueCat Web SDK are currently in beta.
:::

## Overview
Redemption Links is a Web2App feature that allows you to seamlessly connect web purchases with native mobile apps. This reduces friction from the purchase flow, and can be useful for campaigns and other initiatives where handling purchases on the web is easier and more flexible.

:::info App User IDs no longer required for web purchases
Handling purchases with Redemption Links means that you do not need to provide an App User ID when initializing the purchase, and users can therefore check out anonymously. The purchase is then assigned to the logged in user when they're directed into the mobile app _after_ the purchase.
:::

## How Redemption Links Work
Here's how a purchase and redemption flow looks, once you've configured and enabled the feature:

1. The RC Billing purchase flow is initialized, either through the web SDK `purchase()` method, or by linking to a Web Paywall Link (App User ID not required at this stage)
1. The customer purchases a subscription or non-subscription product throught the web checkout.
1. The customer receives a **redemption link** at the end of the purchase flow, both on the success page, and in the email receipt for the purchase.
1. On tapping the redemption link, users are linked into the mobile app (using a custom URL scheme).
1. The app handles associating the purchase with the user, either by aliasing or transferring the purchase.
1. The user has access to their entitlements associated with the web purchase.


## How to configure Redemption Links to redeem web purchases in your mobile apps

### Update your mobile app(s) to accept custom URL schemes from RevenueCat

:::warning Updated mobile apps must be adopted before deploying the feature
After the Redemption Links feature is enabled and users complete the purchase flow without an anonymous App User ID, custom URL schemes will be sent distributed (to redirect the user into your app and redeem the purchase). Users on older app versions that aren't configured to accept custom URL schemes will not be able to use these links. You should therefore make sure most (ideally all) users have updated to your new version before sending them to a purchase flow without an App User ID.

1. copy the sandbox url, paste it in the running simulator web browser (without appending any app_user_id at the end of the url so that an anonymous one will be automatically generated)
1. Complete the sandbox purchase, and then click the redemption link on the success page. (your Android app should be opened automatically and the entitlement made available to your user).
