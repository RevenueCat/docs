## Overview

- **Credit card:** Enabled by default, supports for all major card networks, and 3D Secure authentication (via Stripe)
- **Apple Pay:** A low-friction wallet payment method for customers with stored credit cards on iOS or macOS devices (via Stripe)
- **Google Pay:** A low-friction wallet payment method with the ability to use stored credit cards from Google Play, YouTube, Chrome and Android (via Stripe).

:::info RevenuCat Billing manages payment methods
In general, RevenueCat Billing manages the payment methods that are shown to customers. Other than the additional required configuration below, you do not need to manage or enable payment methods in your Stripe account.
:::

## Configuring credit cards

There is nothing you need to do to configure to accept credit card payments, which are enabled by default.

## Configuring Apple Pay & Google Pay

To use Apple Pay and Google Pay, you need to register the domain where the payment takes place in the Stripe dashboard:

- If you're taking payments through [Web Paywall Links](/web/revenuecat-billing/web-paywall-links/), you should add the `pay.rev.cat` domain.
- If you're initiating purchases with the [Web SDK](/web/revenuecat-billing/), you should add your own domain where payments take place.


### How to add payment domains

:::info Add payment domains in Live mode for production payments
Payment domains added in Test mode can be tested in Sandbox, using real cards (no real charges will be made). You need to add domains in Live mode to enable production purchases.
:::

1. Go to the [Payment Method Domains](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains) page in your Stripe Dashboard.
1. Click "Add a new domain", enter `pay.rev.cat`, and click "Save".
1. (Web SDK only) Click "Add a new domain", and enter the domain where purchases take place on your website, including the subdomain. Click "Save".

You should see the added domains in the list next to a green "Enabled" tag.

Once enabled, Apple Pay and Google Pay will be displayed next to the credit card payment method in the checkout form, when available to the customer. There are no further steps required to handle payments with these methods.
