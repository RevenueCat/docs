:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat Billing and the RevenueCat Web SDK are currently in beta.
:::

Customers purchasing through RevenueCat Billing will receive emails related to their subscriptions and other purchases on the web.

All emails sent to customers are sent:
- From a RevenueCat domain
- With your **app name** as sender name (configured in the RevenueCat Billing app settings)
- With your **support email address** is used as the *reply-to* address (configured in the RevenueCat Billing app settings), or `noreply@revenuecat.com` if not configured.

## Email customization
Lifecycle emails are lightly customized according to your brand colors configured in the RevenueCat dashboard (see [Customization](/web/revenuecat-billing/customization)).

Only the `Page background` and `Primary button` colors are used to brand emails. Text colors are automatically determined, based on contrast with the background.
