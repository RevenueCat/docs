:::info April 2025 U.S. District Court Ruling on External Payment Options
A recent U.S. District Court ruling found Apple in violation of a 2021 injunction meant to allow developers to direct users to external payment options, like Paddle. As a result, iOS developers are now permitted to guide users to web-based payment flows without additional Apple fees or restrictive design requirements. You can [find more details on the RevenueCat blog](https://revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons).

## Overview

This guide walks you through the setup for adding web purchases to your iOS app with RevenueCat Web and Paddle Billing. The flow consists of the following steps:

1. User views RevenueCat paywall (in-app)
1. User clicks a web purchase button on the pwayall, and lands on a web purchase link in the device browser
1. User completes their purchase in the Paddle Billing checkout (presented within the web purchase link)
1. User is redirected back into the mobile app, using a custom URL scheme
1. User is granted access to the premium entitlements associated with the product they purchased

## Current limitations

1. **Free trials** will not be displayed in the package selection page, or summarized in the checkout
1. **Product quantity:** Products purchased with a quantity of more than one (via the quantity adjustment in the Paddle checkout) will be reflected as a single product purchase in RevenueCat.
1. **Customization:** The Paddle overlay checkout only supports a single accent color customization.
1. **Product descriptions:** The "show product descriptions" setting in web purchase links currently has no effect with Paddle purchases.

## Before you begin (prerequisites)

Before you start to configure this flow, you'll need the following:

- A RevenueCat account (sign up [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/))
- A iOS mobile app with the RevenueCat SDK configured (see [getting started](../welcome/overview))
- iOS products configured in RevenueCat (see [product configuration](../../getting-started/quickstart#2-product-configuration))
- A Paddle Sandbox account (sign up [here](https://sandbox-login.paddle.com/signup))
- (Optional) A Paddle Production account (in order to ship a production version, sign up [here](https://login.paddle.com/signup))

## 1. Configure your Paddle account

Applies to: `sandbox`, `production`

### Add a registered payment domain

1. Go to the **Website approval** page under Checkout
1. Click **Add a new domain**
1. Enter `pay.rev.cat`
1. Click **Submit for Approval**

The `pay.rev.cat` domain has been pre-approved by Paddle, should display as approved in your account within a short period of time.

### Set a default payment link

Go to the [Checkout settings](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/checkout-settings) page under Checkout.

If your Paddle account does not already have a default payment link set, enter `https://pay.rev.cat`.

If a default payment link is already configured (because you're using the account for other purposes) you can leave this unchanged. It will not affect your app-to-web purchases.

### Disable abandoned cart emails

The RevenueCat Paddle Billing integration doesn't currently support Paddle's abandoned cart emails. You should disable them [here](https://developer.paddle.com/build/checkout/checkout-recovery#configure-checkout-recovery)

### Add a new API key and define permissions

1. Navigate to the [Authentication](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/authentication-v2) page under Developer Tools
1. Click the **+ New API key** button
1. Give the new key a suitable name and description
1. **Important:** Set the key to NOT expire (differs from default)
1. Set the permissions according to the list below
1. Save the new key
1. Copy the key to your clipboard

:::warning leave key window open
If you close the modal showing the full API key, you will no longer be able to copy it — we recommend you leave this window open until you've saved the key in the RevenueCat config.
:::

The minimum required [permissions](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/about/permissions) for the created API key are:

## 2. Create Paddle config in RevenueCat dashboard

1. Log in to your RevenueCat account
1. Go to your project
1. Go to **Apps & providers**
1. Add a new web configuration
1. Select the Paddle provider
1. Click **Set secret**, paste your Paddle API key and click **Set**

For this use case, we recommend selecting:

**Automatic purchase tracking** — this tracks all purchases from the Paddle account using webhooks, with no additional setup required.
**Autogenerated user IDs** — because we're sending users directly from the mobile app, an app user ID will already be provided and associated to the purchase.

Finally, click **Connect to Paddle** to initiate and test the connection.

## 3. Create products and prices on Paddle

1. Log in to the Paddle Dashboard
1. To create a new product, expand the **Catalog** section in the sidebar and click **Products**.
1. On the top right corner of the page, click **New Product**.
1. Enter the product name and any other optional details like a description then click **Save**.

![](/docs_images/web/paddle/create-product.png)

Then on the prices section, click **New Price**.
Enter details like the base price, the type of pricing (recurring or one-time), the billing period, and any trial periods you are offering and click **Save**.

![](/docs_images/web/paddle/create-price.png)

:::info Product Mapping between RevenueCat and Paddle
A Price in Paddle maps to a Product in the RevenueCat system. So for example, if you create two prices under the same Paddle product, when you import or manually create the products in the RevenueCat dashboard, you'll notice two separate products.

![](/docs_images/web/paddle/revenuecat_paddle_product_mapping.png)

:::

You can read more about **products and prices** in [Paddle's official documentation](https://developer.paddle.com/build/products/create-products-prices).

## 4. Import products to RevenueCat

1. Go to the **Product catalog** in your RevenueCat dashboard, and select the **Products** tab
1. Find your previously added Paddle provider, and click **Import**
1. Check the products you want to use for your web purchases, and click **Import**

The imported products should now be displayed under your Paddle provider on the Products page.

## 5. Create entitlements in RevenueCat

### What is an entitlement?

RevenueCat Entitlements represent a level of access, features, or content that a user is "entitled" to, and are typically unlocked after a user purchases a product.

Entitlements are used to ensure a user has appropriate access to content based on their purchases, without having to manage all of the product identifiers in your app code. For example, you can use entitlements to unlock "pro" features after a user purchases a subscription.

Most apps only have one entitlement, unlocking all premium features. However, if you had two tiers of content such as Gold and Platinum, you would have 2 entitlements.

[Read more about entitlements](../../getting-started/entitlements)

### Adding an entitlement

1. Go to the **Product catalog** in your RevenueCat dashboard, and select the **Entitlements** tab
1. Click **+ New entitlement**
1. Enter an identifier and description for the entitlement, and click **Add**

### Attaching a product to your entitlement

1. Go to your previously created entitlenment and click **Attach** under associated products
1. In the table, check the product from your Paddle provider, and click **Attach**

## 6. Create an offering & packages in RevenueCat

1. Go to the **Product catalog** in your RevenueCat dashboard, and select the **Offerings** tab
1. Click **New offering** to create a new offering
1. Enter a suitable identifier and display name
1. Under **Packages**, click **+ New Package**
1. Select an identifier that corresponds to the billing cycle of your subscription
1. Enter a description
1. In the products list, find your previously-created Paddle provider and select the corresponding Paddle product (this should correspond with the billing cycle you chose in the identifier)
1. Click **Save**

## 7. Create and configure a web purchase link to enable web purchases

### Web Purchase Link basics

1. Go to the **Product catalog** in your RevenueCat dashboard, and select your previously created offering in the **Offerings** tab
1. Go to the **Web Purchase Link** tab and select **Create a Web Purchase Link for this offering**
1. For the **Web config**, choose the Paddle config you created earlier
1. Enter a suitable header and subheader for the package selection page, along with a link to terms & conditions

:::info Package selection skipped by default for web-to-app purchases
When linking to a web purchase from a RevenueCat paywall, by default the package selection page will be skipped and subscribers will land directly on the checkout with the package selected.
:::

### Configure the success redirect

To redirect the subscriber back into to your app after the purchase, you can use a custom URL scheme (see instructions below). You could alternatively redirect the subscriber to a [Universal Link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app), or your own custom page.

**To add a custom URL scheme in iOS:**

1. In Xcode, find your xcodeproj file — Info tab — **URL Types** section.
1. Then add your custom scheme in the **URL Schemes** field.

**Adding your custom URL scheme in the web purchase link redirect:**

Select the **Redirect to a custom success page** option, and enter your URL scheme in the format `YOUR_CUSTOM_SCHEME://`.

:::warning Important: URL schemes on production can require app updates
In order to use a URL scheme on production, your users must be using a version of your app that has the URL scheme configured. Distribute app updates before enabling this feature.
:::

### Choose the repeat purchase behavior

Define what happens when customers to purchase a product while they already have an active subscription or entitlement. For the app-to-web use case, it's recommended to choose **Show the success page**.

:::info Re-purchasing same product not possible
Note that customers can't have more than one active subscription to the same product, or re-purchase a non-consumable product.
:::

## 8. Create a mobile paywall

**If you have an existing mobile paywall configured:**

1. Make sure your existing paywall is attached to the same offering you've configured for web purchases
1. Add a web purchase button to your paywall ([Read more](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/web-purchase-button))

**If you don't have a mobile paywall configured:**

1. Go to **Paywalls** in the RevenueCat dashboard
1. Select **+ New paywall**
1. Choose the offering you created earlier in this guide and click **Add**
1. [follow this detailed guide](../../tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls) on creating a paywall, and add the mobile packages you want to present.
1. Add a web purchase button to your paywall ([Read more](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/web-purchase-button))

### Configure the web purchase button

Once you've added a suitable web purchase button to your paywall:

1. Set the **Open** behavior to **Web purchase**
1. Publish the changes

## 9. Test the purchase flow in sandbox

If you've completed this flow for a sandbox setup, you have several options for testing it:
