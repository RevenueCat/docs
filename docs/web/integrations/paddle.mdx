RevenueCat currently supports web payments through Paddle.

:::info April 2025 U.S. District Court Ruling on External Payment Options
A recent U.S. District Court ruling found Apple in violation of a 2021 injunction meant to allow developers to direct users to external payment options, like Paddle. As a result, iOS developers are now permitted to guide users to web-based payment flows without additional Apple fees or restrictive design requirements. You can [find more details on the RevenueCat blog](https://revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons).
:::

For apps available outside the U.S. App Store, Apple still requires that digital goods and subscriptions be purchased through in-app purchases. Promoting or linking to alternative payment methods within the app for non-U.S. users may lead to app review rejection or removal. Always ensure external payment links are shown only to eligible U.S. users.

### Supported functionality:

- **Importing Paddle purchases to RevenueCat**: Let subscribers purchase on your own website using Paddle, and automatically unlock mobile entitlements based on the Paddle subscription.
- **Embedded checkout (Web SDK)**: Use RevenueCat's [purchases-js SDK](../web-billing/web-sdk) to initialize a purchase in your web app that uses a Paddle checkout, and creates subscriptions in Paddle Billing.
- **Embedded checkout (Web Purchase Links)**: Create a [revenuecat-hosted purchase flow](../web-billing/web-purchase-links) which uses a Paddle checkout, and creates subscriptions in Paddle Billing.
- **Redemption Links**: Allow users to purchase anonymously without logging in, and handle purchase redemption in your mobile app.

:::info Subscriptions, products and prices are managed in Paddle
For all of the above features, Paddle acts as the billing engine and merchant of record. This means that Paddle operates the subscription, sends receipts and emails to subscribers, and handles any subscription management. RevenueCat's Web Billing features such has Customer Portal, product configuration and tax handling are not used when integrating with Paddle.

## 2. Create Paddle config in RevenueCat dashboard

:::info Do this in RevenueCat, for:

- Sandbox
- Production (separate config required)

**Autogenerated user IDs** — because we're sending users directly from the mobile app, an app user ID will already be provided and associated to the purchase.

Finally, click **Connect to Paddle** to initiate and test the connection.

## 3. Create products and prices in Paddle

:::info Product Mapping between RevenueCat and Paddle
A Price in Paddle maps to a Product in the RevenueCat system. So for example, if you create two prices under the same Paddle product, when you import or manually create the products in the RevenueCat dashboard, you'll notice two separate products.

## 5. Create entitlements in RevenueCat

:::info Do this in RevenueCat, for:

- Sandbox
- Production
  :::

### What is an entitlement?

RevenueCat Entitlements represent a level of access, features, or content that a user is "entitled" to, and are typically unlocked after a user purchases a product.

Entitlements are used to ensure a user has appropriate access to content based on their purchases, without having to manage all of the product identifiers in your app code. For example, you can use entitlements to unlock "pro" features after a user purchases a subscription.

Most apps only have one entitlement, unlocking all premium features. However, if you had two tiers of content such as Gold and Platinum, you would have 2 entitlements.

[Read more about entitlements](../../getting-started/entitlements)

### Adding an entitlement

1. Go to the **Product catalog** in your RevenueCat dashboard, and select the **Entitlements** tab
1. Click **+ New entitlement**
1. Enter an identifier and description for the entitlement, and click **Add**

### Attaching a product to your entitlement

1. Go to your previously created entitlenment and click **Attach** under associated products
1. In the table, check the product from your Paddle provider, and click **Attach**

## 6. Create an offering & packages in RevenueCat

:::info Do this in RevenueCat, for:

- Sandbox
- Production
  :::

1. Go to the **Product catalog** in your RevenueCat dashboard, and select the **Offerings** tab
1. Click **New offering** to create a new offering

1. Click **Save**

## 5. Send Paddle tokens to RevenueCat

:::danger Crucial step
Failure to complete this step will result in untracked Paddle subscriptions in RevenueCat.
:::

The following sections provide step-by-step instructions for two methods of sending Paddle tokens to RevenueCat. Whether you prefer a manual integration through the API or automated processing using the "Track new purchases from server-to-sever notifications" feature, this section will guide you in setting up your configuration to ensure all purchases are tracked.

### Manually through our API

You can send your Paddle subscriptions to RevenueCat through the [POST receipt endpoint](/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions/receipt-imports).

The only required fields when sending your Paddle purchase to the RevenueCat API are the following:

- `fetch_token`: Your Paddle subscription ID (`sub_...`) OR your Paddle transaction ID (`txn_...`)
- `app_user_id`: The App User ID that the subscription should be applied to

**Headers**

- `X-Platform`: Should be set to `paddle`.
- `Authorization`: It should be `Bearer YOUR_REVENUECAT_PADDLE_APP_PUBLIC_API_KEY`

import curlContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/paddle_1.curl?raw";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "curl", content: curlContent }]} />

### Track new purchases from server-to-server-notifications

RevenueCat can automatically process Paddle tokens sent through server-to-server notifications. To enable automatic processing of Paddle purchases, ensure the following features are enabled:

- [Paddle Server Notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications/paddle-server-notifications)
- [Track new purchases from server-to-server notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications/paddle-server-notifications#tracking-new-purchases-using-paddle-server-notifications)

## Limitations of the Paddle integration

- We support purchases that contain only one product. Multiple products on a single purchase are not supported.
