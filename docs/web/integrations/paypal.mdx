RevenueCat supports PayPal for tracking revenue from purchases that happen outside RevenueCat. This lets you unlock entitlements and report PayPal revenue in RevenueCat.

:::info PayPal is external-only
PayPal is not supported in RevenueCat Web Billing, Web SDK, Web Purchase Links, or Paywalls.
:::

## Supported features

- Import and sync PayPal purchases created in your own checkout or backend.
- Automatic tracking via PayPal webhooks (server-to-server notifications).
- Manual tracking via the RevenueCat POST receipt endpoint.

### Current limitations

- Only one product per purchase is supported (single item per order or subscription).

## 1. Create PayPal products and plans

Create subscription Products and Plans in PayPal. You will import the PayPal **Plan ID** into RevenueCat as the product identifier.

For detailed steps, see [PayPal Product Setup](/getting-started/entitlements/paypal-products).

## 2. Add a PayPal configuration in RevenueCat

1. Log into your RevenueCat account
2. Go to your project
3. Go to **Apps & providers**
4. Add a new web configuration
5. Select the PayPal provider
6. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the PayPal Developer Dashboard
7. Set whether this is **Sandbox** or **Production**

:::info Sandbox and production are separate
PayPal sandbox and production environments use different credentials. Create separate RevenueCat configurations for each environment.
:::

## 3. Configure purchase tracking

To automatically track PayPal purchases, enable **Track new purchases from server-to-server notifications** in the PayPal configuration. RevenueCat will create and manage the required PayPal webhook for you.

### App User ID detection methods

RevenueCat can associate PayPal purchases with an App User ID in two ways:

1. **Use anonymous App User IDs**: RevenueCat will create an anonymous App User ID for each purchase.
2. **Use PayPal custom_id**: Set PayPal's `custom_id` to the RevenueCat App User ID when you create the subscription or order. RevenueCat will read `custom_id` from webhook events and use it as the App User ID.

If `custom_id` is missing, the purchase will be associated with an anonymous App User ID.

## 4. Import PayPal plans into RevenueCat

1. Go to **Product catalog → Products** in the RevenueCat dashboard
2. Find your PayPal configuration and click **Import**
3. Select the PayPal plans you want to use and click **Import**

## 5. Create entitlements in RevenueCat

Follow the [entitlements guide](/getting-started/entitlements) to attach your PayPal products to entitlements.

## 6. Send PayPal tokens to RevenueCat (manual)

If you are not using webhook-based tracking, you can send PayPal purchases to RevenueCat through the [POST receipt endpoint](/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions/receipt-imports).

The only required fields when sending your PayPal purchase to the RevenueCat API are the following:

- `fetch_token`: Your PayPal subscription ID (starts with `I-`) or a PayPal order/capture ID for one-time purchases.
- `app_user_id`: The App User ID that the purchase should be applied to.

**Headers**

- `X-Platform`: Should be set to `paypal`.
- `Authorization`: It should be `Bearer YOUR_REVENUECAT_PAYPAL_APP_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
