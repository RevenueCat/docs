:::warning Beta Feature
Web Billing (formerly RevenueCat Billing) and the RevenueCat Web SDK are currently in beta.
:::

If you're selling subscriptions and purchases through Web Billing, you may need to register for and charge sales tax and VAT to customers, depending on your business setup and local laws.

Unlike the mobile app stores which act as a merchant of record and handle all taxes, selling directly to customers on the web means taking on any tax obligations that apply, based on:

- The location of your business
- The tax jurisdiction of your customers (country, state/province and county)
- The category of product you're selling

## Stripe Tax support in Web Billing

RevenueCat integrates with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax), which manages registered tax rates and allows you to calculate and collect taxes directly in the Web Billing checkout.

### Additional Stripe fees

If you enable Stripe Tax in your RevenueCat integration, Stripe will charge you the [standard per-transaction fees](https://stripe.com/tax/pricing), for transactions where you're registered to collect taxes. This is in addition to the base Stripe fee for transactions.

### Supported countries

A full list of countries where Stripe Tax allows you to calculate and collect taxes are available in [Stripe's documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries?locale=en-GB#supported-countries).

## How to use Configure Stripe Tax with Web Billing

#### 1: Set up Stripe Tax in your Stripe dashboard

If you have not yet configured Stripe Tax, you should follow the instructions [in your dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overview) to enable automatic tax calculation (these steps may vary depending on your business location).

#### 2: Add tax registrations for relevant locations

Tax rates won't be added to transactions until there are tax registrations added on the [Registrations page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations).

You can use Stripe's built-in threshold monitoring to understand when you need to register for sales tax in a given location. The process for registering varies depending on the authority you're registering with.

#### 3: Enable tax collection in the RevenueCat dashboard

1. Navigate to the Web Billing payment provider in your RevenueCat account.
1. In the **payment provider** settings, enable "automatically collect taxes using Stripe Tax" and save the changes.

When you've completed these steps, the following behaviors will be enabled:

- When a customer begins a purchase through a Web Paywall Link or Web SDK purchase flow, their tax location will be determined.
- If there is a tax rate in Stripe that should be applied, it will be applied to the transaction.
- The customer will see any taxes broken out in the checkout, and in email receipts.
- Subscription renewals will also have relevant tax rates applied.
- You will be able to use [Stripe Tax reports](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/reporting) in the Stripe dashboard.
