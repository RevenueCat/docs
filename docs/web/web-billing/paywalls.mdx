You can use [RevenueCat Paywalls](../../tools/paywalls) as part of a web purchase flow, in a hosted Web Purchase Link. RevenueCat's Paywalls allow you to remotely configure your entire paywall UI without any code changes.

:::info Web SDK support coming soon
We're currently working on adding support for web paywalls in the [purchases-js SDK](web-sdk). Stay tuned!

## The paywall experience on web

Paywalls on web mostly behave as they do on mobile platforms, with some exceptions or additional considerations:

#### Screen sizes

When presenting a paywall on web, you should expect it to be displayed in a greater variety of screen widths. You can use the tablet layout views in the editor to ensure users have a better experience on larger screens.

#### Mobile platform functionality is hidden

Elements like the restore purchases link don't have a web equivalent, and are therefore not shown on web.

## Creating a paywall

Follow the instructions in [Creating Paywalls](../../tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls) to build your paywall using the available components, either from an existing template or from scratch.

## Using a paywall in a Web Purchase Link

Web Purchase Links are a hosted purchase flow that allow you to sell products on the web without code. They include three steps:

1. Package selection
2. Checkout
3. Post-purchase (either the built-in success page or a custom redirect)

They offer two alternatives for the package selection step:

- **Default package selection:** Offers a simple design, with minimal configuration. Lightweight brand customization can be configured (see [Customization](../web-billing/customization))
- **Custom paywall:** Allows full customization, branding and layout. Can be used consistently between iOS, Android and Web.

**How to configure a custom paywall:**

1. Create and configure a web purchase link if you haven't already (see [Creating a Web Purchase Link](web-purchase-links#creating-a-web-purchase-link))
1. Create a paywall (see [Creating a paywall](#creating-a-paywall)), and add it to the same offering used in your web purchase link
1. Edit the web purchase link, and change the **Paywall** option to use your custom paywall:

If you already have a paywall published on the offering, when you create a web purchase link for that offering, it will use the paywall by default.

4. Test the web purchase link in your sandbox environment (see [Testing Web Purchase Links](testing#testing-web-purchase-links))

The paywall should be presented as the package selection step, allowing you to select any of the available web products and proceed through the web checkout and success pages.

## Presenting a paywall from the Web SDK

Web SDK support for Paywalls is coming soon. Stay tuned!
