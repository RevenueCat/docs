You can use [RevenueCat Paywalls](../../tools/paywalls) as part of a web purchase flow in a hosted Web Purchase Link, or directly from your own experience using the [purchases-js SDK](web-sdk). RevenueCat's Paywalls allow you to remotely configure your entire paywall UI without any code changes.

## The paywall experience on web

Paywalls on web mostly behave as they do on mobile platforms, with some exceptions or additional considerations:

#### Screen sizes

When presenting a paywall on web, you should expect it to be displayed in a greater variety of screen widths. You can use the tablet layout views in the editor to ensure users have a better experience on larger screens.

#### Mobile platform functionality is hidden

Elements like the restore purchases link don't have a web equivalent, and are therefore not shown on web.

## Creating a paywall

Follow the instructions in [Creating Paywalls](../../tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls) to build your paywall using the available components, either from an existing template or from scratch.

## Using a paywall in a Web Purchase Link

Web Purchase Links are a hosted purchase flow that allow you to sell products on the web without code. They include three steps:

1. Package selection
2. Checkout
3. Post-purchase (either the built-in success page or a custom redirect)

They offer two alternatives for the package selection step:

- **Default package selection:** Offers a simple design, with minimal configuration. Lightweight brand customization can be configured (see [Customization](../web-billing/customization))
- **Custom paywall:** Allows full customization, branding and layout. Can be used consistently between iOS, Android and Web.

**How to configure a custom paywall:**

1. Create and configure a web purchase link if you haven't already (see [Creating a Web Purchase Link](web-purchase-links#creating-a-web-purchase-link))
1. Create a paywall (see [Creating a paywall](#creating-a-paywall)), and add it to the same offering used in your web purchase link
1. Edit the web purchase link, and change the **Paywall** option to use your custom paywall:

:::info
If you already have a paywall published on the offering, when you create a web purchase link for that offering, it will use the paywall by default.
:::

4. Test the web purchase link in your sandbox environment (see [Testing Web Purchase Links](testing#testing-web-purchase-links))

The paywall should be presented as the package selection step, allowing you to select any of the available web products and proceed through the web checkout and success pages.

## Presenting a paywall from the Web SDK

The [purchases-js SDK](web-sdk) can host and manage the complete paywall experience via the `presentPaywall` method. This call renders the paywall, handles the purchase flow, and resolves once control returns to your app.

```ts title="Presenting a paywall"
const targetElement = document.getElementById("show-paywall-here");

purchases
  .presentPaywall({
    htmlTarget: targetElement,
    // offering: optional offering to be used. If omitted, the current offering is used.
  })
  .then((purchaseResult: PurchaseResult) => {
    console.log("Purchase successful!", purchaseResult);
  })
  .catch((err: Error) => {
    console.error("Error presenting paywall", err);
  });
```

If you do not pass an offering, the paywall for the offering marked as `current` will be shown. Passing an offering allows you to present another paywall that is available to the customer.

## Adding Apple Pay or Google Pay buttons to a web paywall with the express checkout component

Web paywalls support the **Express checkout** component, which allows users to purchase using Apple Pay or Google Pay directly from the paywall. This makes the purchase experience on mobile devices faster, more seamless, and similar to the native app experience.

You can configure Express checkout by adding the **Express checkout** and **Wallet** components in the Paywall Editor. For more information, see [Express checkout components](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#express-checkout).

### How express checkout works

- The component will render an Apple Pay or Google Pay button, if supported by the user's device and browser.
- The Web Billing checkout is skipped entirely when users purchase through express checkout.
- Users have the option to complete their purchase with the full checkout, if they prefer to use a different payment method (using the standard purchase button component).
- **Tax handling:** If you have automatic tax handling enabled in the web billing config, the billing address from the walley payment method will be used to determine the user's tax location. Subscribers have the ability to modify this in the native payment UI.
- **Updating payment methods:** After purchasing, subscribers can still update their payment method and manage their subscription through the [Customer Portal](customer-portal)
- **Error handling:** Any errors related to the payment are reflected in the native payment UI on the device.

### Troubleshooting Apple Pay and Google Pay visibility

In order to present either an Apple Pay or Google Pay button on a web paywall, the following should be true:

- Apple Pay or Google Pay are configured within your Stripe account, and your purchase domain is registered ([see how](payment-methods#configuring-apple-pay--google-pay))
- Both the device and browser are configured to use the payment method (in some cases this means having a registered credit card on file)

For further troubleshooting, we recommend using [Stripe's test page for wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/testing/wallets) to make sure the payment methods are rendering in the Express Checkout Element demo, and check browser-level settings.

For Apple Pay, read Apple's [device compatibility](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102896) and [region compatibility](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102775) guides to make sure the service is available to you.
