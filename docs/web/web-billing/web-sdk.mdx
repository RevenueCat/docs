## Introduction

RevenueCat's Web SDK allow you to easily sell subscriptions and other purchases in your web app. It utilizes Stripe as the payment gateway, so you'll need a Stripe account to connect with your RevenueCat account.

Web Billing differs from external payment integrations in that it takes care of the purchase UI, the subscription management portal, and the recurring billing logic.

When using Web Billing, Stripe will still charge a [payment processing fee](https://stripe.com/pricing) for transactions, but you will not have to pay [Stripe Billing fees](https://stripe.com/billing/pricing).

## Installation

Start by installing the `@revenuecat/purchases-js` package using the package manager of your choice:

import npmContent from "@site/code_blocks/_projects/web-billing/installation-npm.shell?raw";
import yarnContent from "@site/code_blocks/_projects/web-billing/installation-yarn.shell?raw";
import webBillingContent from "@site/code_blocks/_projects/web-billing/web-billing-doc-snippets.ts.txt?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "shell", content: npmContent, name: "npm" },
    { type: "shell", content: yarnContent, name: "yarn" },
  ]}
/>

<br />

:::info
When testing Web Billing with [unpkg](https://www.unpkg.com/), add `Purchases` before all method names to access them.
For example, use `Purchases.Purchases.configure()` instead of `Purchases.configure()`.
:::

## General setup

### Connect with Stripe

To get started, you first need to [connect your Stripe account with RevenueCat](/web/connect-stripe-account), if you haven't already done so.

### App configuration

To start using Web Billing, you will need to add a Web Billing platform to your project. To do that, go to **Project settings > Platforms** and add a new _Web Billing_ web platform to your project.

![New Web Billing Platform](/docs_images/projects/add-web-platform.png)

In the following step, you can set up the most important information for the new App:

- **Stripe Account**: The Stripe account to use. To use a different Stripe account not shown in the list, [connect it to RevenueCat first](/web/connect-stripe-account).
- **Default Currency**: The default currency to use for the prices of the products. [Read more about multi-currency support in Web Billing](/web/web-billing/multi-currency-support).
- **App Name**: The name of the app. This will also be shown in the purchase flow, in emails, and on invoices.
- **Support Email**: An email address that customers can send support requests to. This will also be shown in the purchase flow, in emails, and on invoices.
- **Store URLs**: Links to your native iOS and Android apps that are used in the checkout and emails, to enable customers to download them after purchasing.
- **Redemption Links settings**: See [Redemption Links](/web/web-billing/redemption-links/) for how to configure them.
- **Appearance**: The Appearance tab allows customizing the look and feel of the purchase flow, including colors, button shapes and more. [Read more about customizing the appearance](/web/web-billing/customization).

![New Web Billing App](/docs_images/web/web-billing/new-web-billing-configuration.png)

After creating the app, some additional fields will be shown:

- **App icon**: You can upload an app icon here that will be shown in the purchase flow, in emails, and on invoices.
- **Logo**: You can additionally upload a full size logo or wordmark that will be shown instead of the App Icon when appropriate. We recommend transparent PNG images.
- **Public API Key**: The API key to be used in your web application when initializing the SDK. This key is safe to be included in production code.
- **Sandbox API Key**: The API key to be used for [testing](#Testing) purposes. Do not share this API key or include it in your production web app, as it allows to make purchases and unlocking entitlements using test cards.

### Product configuration

To get started with the Web SDK, you should follow the regular setup of [entitlements, products, and offerings](/getting-started/entitlements).

However, you can configure your product and its duration [directly in the RevenueCat dashboard](/web/web-billing/product-setup):

![New product configuration page](/docs_images/web/web-billing/new-product-configuration.png)

## SDK configuration

Configure the RevenueCat Web SDK by calling the static `configure()` method of the `Purchases` class:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Configuring SDK",
    },
  ]}
/>

:::warning Only configure once
You should configure the SDK only once in your code.
:::

You can use the object returned from the `configure()` method to call any of the SDK methods, or use the static method `getSharedInstance()` of the `Purchases` class to returned the initialized `Purchases` object.

The method will throw an exception if the SDK has not yet been configured.

You can use both anonymous and identified app user ids when configuring the SDK, check out the next section to understand the differences.

## Identifying Customers

The RevenueCat Web SDK supports both [identified](/customers/user-ids) and [anonymous](/customers/user-ids#anonymous-app-user-ids) customers, offering flexibility in how you manage user accounts and subscriptions.
Both anonymous and identified customers are supported by the SDK and by the [Web Purchase Links](/web/web-billing/web-purchase-links).
Here’s how these options work:

### Identified Customers

For identified customers, you provide a unique App User ID linked to the customer’s account. This is ideal for apps with authentication mechanisms or shared subscription access between platforms (e.g., web and mobile). To implement this approach:

- Use a third-party authentication provider like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) / [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) or a library like [auth.js](https://authjs.dev/).
- By sharing authentication across your web app and mobile apps, customers can seamlessly access subscriptions they purchased on any platform without additional configuration—just map products to the correct entitlements.

Here’s how you can configure `purchases-js` to use identified customers:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Configuring SDK",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Anonymous Customers

With [Redemption Links](/web/web-billing/redemption-links/), anonymous customers can now purchase subscriptions on the web without being logged into an account. These customers can later redeem their purchases on mobile apps or other platforms.
Redemption Links enable you to:

- Share subscription access without requiring user authentication.
- Ensure purchases remain accessible, even for anonymous users.

Here’s how you can configure `purchases-js` to use anonymous customers:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Configuring SDK Anon",
    },
  ]}
/>

Find out more about Redemption Links and how to set them up [here](/web/web-billing/redemption-links/) .

## Getting customer information

You can access the customer information using the `getCustomerInfo()` method of the `Purchases` object:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Getting customer information",
    },
  ]}
/>

You can then use the `entitlements` property of the `CustomerInfo` object to check whether the customer has access to a specific entitlement:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Check for specific entitlement",
    },
  ]}
/>

If your app has multiple entitlements, you might also want to check if the customer has any active entitlements:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Check for any entitlement",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Building your paywall

### Getting and displaying products

We recommend using [Offerings](/getting-started/entitlements#offerings) to configure which products get presented to the customer. You can access the offerings for a given app user ID with the (asynchronous) method `purchases.getOfferings()`. The current offering for the customer is contained in the `current` property of the return value.

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Get current offerings",
    },
  ]}
/>

If you want to [support multiple currencies](/web/web-billing/multi-currency-support) and manually specify the currency, you can pass the currency code to the `getOfferings()` method. If you do not specify the currency, RevenueCat will attempt to geolocate the customer and use the currency of the customer's country if it's available, or fall back to the default currency of the app.

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Get current offerings for EUR",
    },
  ]}
/>

It's also possible to access other Offerings besides the Current Offering directly by its identifier.

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Get custom offering",
    },
  ]}
/>

Each Offering contains a list of Packages. Packages can be accessed in a few different ways:

1. via the `.availablePackages` property on an Offering.
2. via the duration convenience property on an Offering
3. via the `.packagesById` property of an Offering, keyed by the package identifier

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Displaying packages",
    },
  ]}
/>

Each Package contains information about the product in the `webBillingProduct` property:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Getting product",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Purchasing a package

To purchase a package, use the `purchase()` method of the `Purchases` object. It returns a `Promise<{customerInfo: CustomerInfo}>`. To handle errors, you should catch any exceptions that occur.

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Purchasing package",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Customizing the purchase flow

The `purchase()` method accepts a `PurchaseParams` object to set custom purchase options, including the following:

- Send the customer's billing email address, skipping the email collection step (`customerEmail`)
- Setting the selected and default locales (`defaultLocale`, `selectedLocale`) — see [Localization](/web/web-billing/localization)
- Setting the HTML target element for the purchase flow to be rendered in (`htmlTarget`)
- Passing purchase metadata to be sent to the backend (`metadata`) — see [Custom Metadata](/web/web-billing/custom-metadata)
