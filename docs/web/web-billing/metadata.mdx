Web Billing supports custom metadata that you can send along when executing the purchase.
The metadata will be propagated to webhook events and the Stripe customer object to enable its use in other systems, such as marketing or attribution tools.

`purchases-js` will also automatically collect any `utm` parameters in the URL and send it as metadata when invoking `purchase()`.
You can opt-out of this behavior by setting the `autoCollectUTMAsMetadata` flag to `false` in the `configure` method.

## How to send custom metadata when invoking purchase()

When invoking `purchase()`, you can provide a `metadata` object using the `PurchaseParams` interface

import webBillingContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/_projects/web-billing/web-billing-doc-snippets.ts";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Purchasing package with metadata",
    },
  ]}
/>

The `metadata` property accepts a key-value object with any custom data you want to send along with the purchase.
The accepted values are `string`, `number`, `boolean` and `null`.

After purchasing with the metadata set up you will receive it in the Initial Purchase webhook event and in the Stripe Customer object.

## Opt out of the automatic collection of UTM parameters

You can opt-out of the automatic collection of UTM parameters by setting the `autoCollectUTMAsMetadata` flag to `false` in the `configure` method.
Here's an example:

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Configuring SDK without automatic UTM collection",
    },
  ]}
/>
