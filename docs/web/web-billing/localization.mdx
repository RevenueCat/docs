:::warning Beta translations
Our localization support is in beta, and supported translations may include minor issues. We're working to validate these, and appreciate your input!Â Please [contact us](mailto:support%40revenuecat.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-js/issues) in our github repo with any corrections or general feedback on translations).
:::

## Overview

- Web Billing supports localization for 33 languages in the Web SDK.
- Localization affects the entire purchase flow, including the checkout form (excluding any possible secondary payment flows such as 3D Secure authentication).
- Product names and descriptions are not localized, and will be shown in their original form (as defined in the RevenueCat Dashboard).
- Prices configured through [multi-currency support](/web/web-billing/multi-currency-support/) are now formatted following the selected locale in the purchase flow.

### Current limitations

Currently, the following limitations apply to localization support:

- It is not possible to override any strings for the given languages.
- It is not possible to specify the language used in Web Purchase Links (hosted purchase flow).
- Some of the supported languages may have minor translation issues, and we're working to validate them (please [contact us](mailto:support%40revenuecat.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-js/issues) in our github repo with any corrections or general feedback on translations).

## How to use localization support in purchases-js

:::info Web SDK version compatibility
Localization is supported in purchases-js version 0.14.0 and above.
:::

When invoking `purchase()`, you can provide a `selectedLocale` or `defaultLocale` using the `PurchaseParams` interface:

import webBillingContent from "@site/code_blocks/_projects/web-billing/web-billing-doc-snippets.txt?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: webBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Configuring locale",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Supported languages

The following language codes can be specified as locales:
