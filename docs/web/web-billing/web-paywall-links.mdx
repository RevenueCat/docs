:::warning Beta Feature
Web Billing (formerly RevenueCat Billing), the RevenueCat Web SDK, and Web Paywall Links are currently in beta.
:::

## Overview

Use Web Paywall Links to allow customers to purchase a Web Billing subscription directly without having to write any code.
Simply append a customer's App User ID to the provided URL and share the link with the customer.

## Get Started

1. Create a [Web Billing App](/web/web-billing/web-sdk#app-configuration)
2. Add the [Web Billing Products](/web/web-billing/product-setup) you want to serve through your Web Paywall Link
3. Create an [Offering](/tools/offerings-guide) with those Products
4. Visit that Offering's details page and click on the **Web Paywall Link** tab
5. Finally, click on the **Create a Web Paywall Link for this Offering** button

## Customise your Web Paywall Link

Choose a Web Billing app from the dropdown if you have more than one

### Package Selection page

The first page your customers will see when accessing your Web Paywall Link is the Package selection page.
In this page your customers can select one of the products included in your offering.

Here is an example:

![](/images/web-billing/web-paywall-link-package-example.png)

You can customize the:

- The header
- The subheader
- Choose to show or not the product description (check the [product setup](/web/web-billing/product-setup) step for more info)
- The terms and conditions URL

### Success page

After subscribing the Web Paywall Link allows you to congratulate the user in 2 ways:

- Show a download page hosted by RevenueCat
- Redirect to any URL you like

#### Show a download page

If you choose to show a download page here's how it will look like:

You can customize the download page:

- Header
- Subheader
- Choose whether to show the app download buttons
- Configure the links for
- App Store
- Play Store

#### Redirect to a custom URL

In this case, right after purchasing your product, the customer will be redirected to the URL that you specify in the
Web Paywall Link configuration.

Once you are ready, click Save and your changes will be applied immediately.

:::warning Immediate apply
As soon as you click save, any subscriber visiting your Web Paywall Link will see the changes immediately.

You can always run tests by creating a Web Paywall Link for another offering.
:::

## Choose what happens for returning customers

You can choose what happens when a customer already has an entitlement or an active subscription and they return to this page.

![](/images/web-billing/web-paywall-link-choose-returning-customers.png)

### Show the success page

Automatically skips the Package Selection page. It will use the configuration you set up for the success page (show a download page or redirect to a custom URL).

### Allow them to make another purchase

Allows the returning customer to purchase another product.

:::warning Might fail when purchasing
This configuration is useful for non-consumable products.
The re-purchase process will fail if the customer tries to purchase the exact same product twice (subscription or non-consumable).

We suggest to create a dedicated offering/web paywall link for non-consumables to make sure all products can be bought as many times as the customer wants.
:::

## Sending your Web Paywall Links

Once you finalize your setup you will receive 2 links of the form `https://pay.rev.cat/<someProductionTokenWeGenerate>/<yourAppUserId>` (one for production, the other one for sandbox).

To use these links:

- If you're not using [Redemption Links](/web/web-billing/redemption-links) to enable anonymous web purchases, you will need to append a [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) App User ID of the customer you want to be able to subscribe from the link. Without appending the app user ID, **the link will not work**.
- If you're using [Redemption Links](/web/web-billing/redemption-links), you can use the Web Payment Link URLs without appending an App User ID. Anonymous user IDs will be generated until purchases are redeemed in-app.

:::danger Do not send the sandbox URL to customers
The Sandbox URL allows you to test purchases using [Stripe test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#use-test-cards).
Do not distribute this link or whoever will use it will be able to subscribe to your application for free using one
of the Stripe testing cards.
:::

:::warning Use one unique App User ID per customer
Web Billing works with identified customers. You need to specify a unique app user id for each one of the subscribers you
want to reach with this link. You can read more about this requirement [here](/web/web-billing/web-sdk#identifying-customers).
:::

### URL parameters

#### Email

If you already have your customer's email address, use `email` to preset an email address on the payment page: `https://pay.rev.cat/<someProductionTokenWeGenerate>/<yourAppUserId>?email=<customerEmail>`

#### Currency

If you want to specify a currency manually, you can do so by appending the `currency` query parameter to the URL. This will override the automatic currency selection.

:::info
We recommend that all URL parameters are [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) to avoid potential issues.
