### Canceling subscriptions

You can cancel a customer's subscription. This means that the subscription will expire at the end of the current billing period. The customer will retain access to their entitlements until the subscription expires.

To cancel a subscription, click on the "..." menu on the subscription in the "Entitlements" card of the customer profile and then select "Cancel subscription".
