# Web Billing overview

RevenueCat Web Billing allows you to easily start selling subscriptions and one-time purchases on the web, and connect them with the same subscriptions and entitlements on mobile.

This enables use cases such as:

- Running paid acquisition campaigns linked to a web purchase flow
- Running web-based win-back campaigns with special offers tailored to customers with churned subscriptions
- Collecting web payments from an existing audience, without the need to install the app first or create an account
- Offering a unified experience for your app across mobile and web, with the same set of entitlements

:::info April 2025 U.S. District Court Ruling on External Payment Options
A recent U.S. District Court ruling found Apple in violation of a 2021 injunction meant to allow developers to direct users to external payment options, like Web Billing. As a result, iOS developers are now permitted to guide users to web-based payment flows without additional Apple fees or restrictive design requirements. You can [find more details on the RevenueCat blog](https://revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons).
:::

For apps available outside the U.S. App Store, Apple still requires that digital goods and subscriptions be purchased through in-app purchases. Promoting or linking to alternative payment methods within the app for non-U.S. users may lead to app review rejection or removal. Always ensure external payment links are shown only to eligible U.S. users.

## Web Billing integration paths

#### Web SDK

If you run a dynamic web app and have access to the code, you should consider integrating the Web SDK, as a way to initialize purchases (similarly to RevenueCat's mobile SDKs).

[Get started with the Web SDK](web-sdk)

#### Web Purchase Links

If you want a low-code way to collect payments from customers, you can use Web Purchase Links, which provide a customizable purchase flow hosted by RevenueCat. This is useful if you need to distribute payment links from static systems such as emails, social media, or a static landing page.

### Current limitations

Web Billing currently has a number of known limitations. Most notably:

- There is no support for sales tax or VAT calculation.
- There is no support for discounts or other offers.
- There is no support for our Paywall templates yet.
- We do not collect the customer's name, shipping address or full billing address. Consequently, Web Billing cannot be used in India and in other countries that have this requirement.

## Web Billing vs. Stripe Billing integration

**Web Billing** is RevenueCat's full subscription management solution, which uses Stripe as a payment processor.

- It takes care of the end-to-end purchase UI
- It manages the complete subscription lifecycle, including the recurring billing logic (instead of Stripe Billing)
- It provides a RevenueCat purchase portal for customers

**Our Stripe Billing integration** allows you to use Stripe Billing for subscriptions, and sync them to RevenueCat.

If you're getting started with web billing for your apps, it's recommended to use RevenueCat Web Billing for a deeper integration with the RevenueCat platform.

If you already have a Stripe Billing implementation with active subscriptions and customers, you may want to maintain that setup and use our [Stripe Billing](/web/integrations/stripe) integration.

### Fee comparison

RevenueCat Web is included in [RevenueCat's price](https://www.revenuecat.com/pricing); there are no additional RevenueCat fees to support subscriptions and purchases on the web.
