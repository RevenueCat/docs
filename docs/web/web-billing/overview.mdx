# Web Billing overview

RevenueCat Web Billing allows you to easily start selling subscriptions and one-time purchases on the web, and connect them with the same subscriptions and entitlements on mobile.

This enables use cases such as:

- Running paid acquisition campaigns linked to a web purchase flow
- Running web-based win-back campaigns with special offers tailored to customers with churned subscriptions
- Collecting web payments from an existing audience, without the need to install the app first or create an account
- Offering a unified experience for your app across mobile and web, with the same set of entitlements

## Web Billing integration paths

#### Web SDK

If you run a dynamic web app and have access to the code, you should consider integrating the Web SDK, as a way to initialize purchases (similarly to RevenueCat's mobile SDKs).

[Get started with the Web SDK](web-sdk)

#### Web Payment Links (low code)

If you want a low-code way to collect payments from customers, you can use Web Payment Links, which provide a customizable purchase flow hosted by RevenueCat. This is useful if you need to distribute payment links from static systems such as emails, social media, or a static landing page.

[Get started with Web Paywall Links](web-paywall-links)

## Web Billing vs. Stripe Billing integration

**Web Billing** is RevenueCat's full subscription management solution, which uses Stripe as a payment processor.

- It takes care of the end-to-end purchase UI
- It manages the complete subscription lifecycle, including the recurring billing logic (instead of Stripe Billing)
- It provides a RevenueCat purchase portal for customers

**Our Stripe Billing integration** allows you to use Stripe Billing for subscriptions, and sync them to RevenueCat.

If you're getting started with web billing for your apps, it's recommended to use RevenueCat Web Billing for a deeper integration with the RevenueCat platform.

If you already have a Stripe Billing implementation with active subscriptions and customers, you may want to maintain that setup and use our [Stripe Billing](/web/integrations/stripe) integration.
