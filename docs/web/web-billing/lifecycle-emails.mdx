:::info California requirements for auto-renewing subscriptions
Beginning July 1, 2025, new rules apply for customers in California related to auto-renewing subscriptions, including wording changes at the time of purchase and renewal notification emails for subscriptions. RevenueCat has implemented new lifecycle emails to comply with the updated rules: [see below](#optional-lifecycle-emails-for-auto-renewing-subscriptions).
:::

Customers purchasing through Web Billing (formerly RevenueCat Billing) will receive emails related to their subscriptions and other purchases on the web.

Emails sent to customers:

- Come from a RevenueCat domain
- Display your **app name** as the sender (configured in Web Billing settings)
- Use your **support email address** as the _reply-to_ (configured in the Web Billing app settings, if set) or `noreply@revenuecat.com` by default‚Äù

### Email customization

Lifecycle emails are lightly customized according to your brand colors configured in the RevenueCat dashboard (see [Customization](/web/web-billing/customization)).

Only the `Page background` and `Primary button` colors are used to brand emails. Text colors are automatically determined, based on contrast with the background.
