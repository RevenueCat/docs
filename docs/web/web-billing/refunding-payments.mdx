### Refunding payments

You can refund a one-time or non-subscription purchase made by a customer, or the most recent payment of a customer's subscription.

Refunding returns the funds to the customer's payment method (it can take a few days for the payment to be returned, depending on the payment method and the customer's bank). When a refund is made, the customer immediately loses access to any entitlements associated with their subscription, or purchased item.

:::info No refund for subscriptions with billing issues
For subscriptions where the most recent invoice failed to be collected, you can't refund the payment (since no payment was made). You can still cancel the subscription.
:::

To refund a payment, click on the "..." menu on the subscription in the "Entitlements" card of the customer profile and then select "Refund".
