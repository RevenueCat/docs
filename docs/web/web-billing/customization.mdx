Using the appearance editor in the RevenueCat Dashboard, you can customize the appearance of the Web Billing UIÂ to match your app's branding. This includes the colors and shapes of certain UI elements.

This customization currently applies to:

- The purchase flow initiated by the Web SDK
- Web Paywall Links
- [Lifecycle emails](/web/web-billing/lifecycle-emails) sent to customers.

To customize the appearance to your brand, go to the app settings for your Web Billing app in the RevenueCat dashboard, select to the **Appearance** tab and click **Open Editor**. Here you'll see a mobile preview of the checkout, with styling applied.
