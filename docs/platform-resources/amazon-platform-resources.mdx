RevenueCat provides SDK's and integrations for Amazon to make in-app purchase and subscription development simple. Use these resources to take full advantage of all RevenueCat has to offer for the Amazon Appstore.

If you're looking for sample apps, head over to our [Sample Apps](/platform-resources/sample-apps) doc.

## Configuration

## Syncing Purchases When Your App Is Completing Transactions

When the SDK is configured to not complete purchases on the Amazon Appstore, `syncAmazonPurchase` will need to be called to ensure purchases are recorded. **Failure to do so will result in no purchases being recorded**.
