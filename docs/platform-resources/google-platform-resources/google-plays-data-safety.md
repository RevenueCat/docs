[By July 20, 2022](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en), Google requires all developers to declare how their application collects and handles user data. You'll need to ensure you are properly disclosing to your users the way you are using RevenueCat in regards to their data.

## Data collection and security

### Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types?

Select 'Yes'. RevenueCat collects a customer's purchase history.

### Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit?

Select 'Yes'. RevenueCat encrypts data in transit.

### Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted?

If selecting 'Yes', ensure your customers have a way to contact your support team to request a data deletion. You will be able to [delete the customer](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#delete-customer) directly from the RevenueCat dashboard or via [REST API](ref:subscribersapp_user_id).
