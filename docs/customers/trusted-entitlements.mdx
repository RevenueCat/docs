RevenueCat uses strong SSL to secure communications against interception. But the user is in control of the client device, and, while not an easy process, they can configure it to allow and execute [MiTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks to grant themselves entitlements without actually paying you.

To prevent this, in addition to SSL for secure communications, our native (iOS/Android) SDKs, together with our backend, will verify responses integrity by checking a cryptographic signature.

:::info
Trusted Entitlements is supported in iOS SDK version 4.25.0 and up, and Android SDK version 6.6.0 and up.

## Setup

### Configuration

Trusted Entitlements is enabled by default and it doesn't have any impact on performance or behavior by default. You can disable it by doing the following:


import content1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements.swift";
import content2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements.m";
import content3 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements.kt";
import content4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements.dart";
import content5 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements-rn.ts";
import content6 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements-capacitor.ts";
import content7 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/trusted-entitlements.cs";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        content: content1,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        content: content2,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        content: content3,
    },
    {
        type: 'flutter',
        content: content4,
    },
    {
        type: 'rn',
        content: content5,
    },
    {
        type: 'capacitor',
        content: content6,
    },
    {
        type: 'unity',
        content: content7,
    },
    
]}/>


### Verification

When Trusted Entitlements are enabled, `EntitlementInfo` contains the verification result:

import content8 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result.swift";
import content9 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result.m";
import content10 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result.kt";
import content11 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result.dart";
import content12 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result-rn.ts";
import content13 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result-capacitor.ts";
import content14 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/verification-result.cs";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        content: content8,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        content: content9,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        content: content10,
    },
    {
        type: 'flutter',
        content: content11,
    },
    {
        type: 'rn',
        content: content12,
    },
    {
        type: 'capacitor',
        content: content13,
    },
    {
        type: 'unity',
        content: content14,
    },
    
]}/>


Additionally, verification errors are always forwarded to `Purchases.errorHandler`.

## Edge cases

### Cache leftover

Transitioning an app from `EntitlementVerificationMode.disabled` to `EntitlementVerificationMode.informational` means that cached data would not be verified. The SDK will keep using that cached data, which should be updated with the result of the verification after a request to the RevenueCat servers is performed successfully. In this scenario, the `EntitlementInfo` will have a VerificationResult of "not requested". You may clear the CustomerInfo cache by calling the `Purchases/invalidateCustomerInfoCache()` method in the SDK if you want to avoid having unverified entitlements.

### Key replacement

We use intermediate keys that are rotated frequently. These are signed by a root key. In the very unlikely event that the root key is compromised and needs to be replaced, this would be the process:

- The old pair would be considered insecure
- A new version of API endpoints would be added
- A new version of the SDK that uses the new set of endpoints and the new public key would be rolled out

In this way, apps using the old version of the SDK would continue to work, but they would have to be updated to the new set of keys if they want to continue being secure against tampering.

## Compatibility

- Android 4.4+
- iOS 13.x+
