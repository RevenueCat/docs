## Get User Information

The CustomerInfo object contains all of the purchase and subscription data available about the user. This object is updated whenever a purchase or restore occurs and periodically throughout the lifecycle of your app. The latest information can always be retrieved by calling `getCustomerInfo()`:

import content2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_2.m";

It's safe to call `getCustomerInfo()` frequently throughout your app. Since the SDK updates and caches the latest CustomerInfo when the app becomes active, the completion block won't need to make a network request in most cases.

:::info Working with the cache

The SDK caches the user's subscription information to reduce your app's reliance on the network. Users who unlock entitlements will be able to access them even without an internet connection. The SDK will update the cache if it's older than 5 minutes, but only if you call `getCustomerInfo()`, make a purchase, or restore purchases, so it's a good idea to call `getCustomerInfo()` any time a user accesses premium content.
:::

The `CustomerInfo` object gives you access to the following information about a user:

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Request Date                | The server date when the current CustomerInfo object was fetched. This is affected by the cache on device so you should not use it when you need the current time to calculate info such as time elapsed since purchase date. For that you should use device time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Original App User ID        | The original App User ID recorded for this user. May be the same as their current App User ID.

| Original Purchase Date      | iOS only. The date that the app was first purchased/downloaded by the user. Will be `nil` if no receipt is recorded for the user. Useful for [migrating existing apps to subscriptions](/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Management URL              | URL to manage the active subscription of the user. If the user has an active iOS subscription, this will point to the App Store, if the user has an active Play Store subscription it will point there. For Stripe subscriptions, there is no Management URL. \n \nIf there are no active subscriptions it will be null. \n \nIf the user has multiple active subscriptions for different platforms, this will take the value of the OS in the X-Platform header into consideration: \n﻿- If the request was made on an OS for which there are active subscriptions, this will return the URL for the store that matches the header. \n﻿- If the request was made on a different OS or the OS was not included in the X-Platform header, this will return the URL for the store of the subscription with the farthest future expiration date. |
| All Purchased Product Identifiers | An array of product identifiers purchased by the user regardless of expiration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Checking If A User Is Subscribed

The subscription status for a user can easily be determined with the `CustomerInfo` and `EntitlementInfo` objects.

For most apps that only have one entitlement, the `isActive` status can be quickly checked for your entitlement ID.

import content9 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_9.swift";
import content10 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_10.m";
import content11 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_11.kt";
import content12 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_12.java";
import content13 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_13.js";

import content15 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_15.js";
import content16 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_16.cs";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        content: content9,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        content: content10,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        content: content11,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        content: content12,
    },
    {
        type: 'flutter',
        content: content13,
    },
    {
        type: 'rn',
        content: content14,
    },
    {
        type: 'cordova',
        content: content15,
    },
    {
        type: 'unity',
        content: content16,
    },
    { type: 'ts', content: rcBillingContent, name: "Web (JS/TS)", region: "Check for specific entitlement" },
]}/>

If your app has multiple entitlements, you might also want to check if the customer has any active entitlements:

import content17 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_17.swift";
import content18 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_18.m";

import content20 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_20.java";
import content21 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_21.js";
import content22 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_22.js";
import content23 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_23.js";
import content24 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_24.cs";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        content: content17,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        content: content18,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        content: content19,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        content: content20,
    },
    {
        type: 'flutter',
        content: content21,
    },
    {
        type: 'rn',
        content: content22,
    },
    {
        type: 'cordova',
        content: content23,
    },
    {
        type: 'unity',
        content: content24,
    },
    { type: 'ts', content: rcBillingContent, name: "Web (JS/TS)", region: "Check for any entitlement" },
]}/>


It's important to note that CustomerInfo will be empty if no purchases have been made and no transactions have been synced. This means that entitlements may not exist in CustomerInfo even if they have been set up in the RevenueCat dashboard.

## Listening For CustomerInfo Updates

Since _Purchases_ SDK works seamlessly on any platform, a user's CustomerInfo may change from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in CustomerInfo by conforming to an optional delegate method, `purchases:receivedUpdated:`. This will fire whenever we receive a _change_ in CustomerInfo _on the current device_ and you should expect it to be called at launch and throughout the life of the app.

CustomerInfo updates are not pushed to your app from the RevenueCat backend, updates can only happen from an outbound network request to RevenueCat.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to customer information the next time your app is launched. Or throughout your app as you request new `CustomerInfo` objects.

        content: content32,
    },

## Getting subscription status via the REST API

If you  need to get a user's subscription status from outside of the _Purchases SDK_, for example, from your own backend, you should use the REST API. You can read the full API reference [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

import content33 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_33.curl";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'curl',
        content: content33,
    },
]}/>

## Handling Refunds

RevenueCat can handle refunds across all platforms for both subscription and non-subscription products. As soon as RevenueCat detects a refund, the CustomerInfo will be updated to reflect the correct entitlement status - no action required on your part! If you have questions about refunds, take a look at our [community article](https://community.revenuecat.com/general-questions-7/how-do-i-issue-a-refund-115) covering the topic.
