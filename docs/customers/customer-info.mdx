RevenueCat makes it easy to determine subscription status and more with the RevenueCat SDK and [REST API](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

## Getting subscription status via the SDK

The CustomerInfo object contains all of the purchase and subscription data available about a customer.

This object is updated whenever a purchase or restore occurs and periodically throughout the lifecycle of your app. The latest information can always be retrieved by calling `getCustomerInfo()`:

import content1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_1.swift";
import content2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_2.m";
import content3 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_3.kt";
import content4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_4.java";
import content5 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_5.js";
import content6 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_6.js";
import content7 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_7.js";
import contentCapacitor from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_add_listener_capacitor.ts";
import content8 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_8.cs";
import rcBillingContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/_projects/rc-billing/rc-billing-doc-snippets.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        content: content1,

    {
        type: 'objc',
        content: content2,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        content: content3,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        content: content4,
    },
    {
        type: 'flutter',
        content: content5,
    },
    {
        type: 'rn',
        content: content6,
    },
    {
        type: 'cordova',

    },
    {

        content: contentCapacitor,
    },
    {

    },
    { type: 'ts', content: rcBillingContent, name: "Web (JS/TS)", region: "Getting customer information" },

]}/>

It's safe to call `getCustomerInfo()` frequently throughout your app. Since the SDK updates and caches the latest CustomerInfo when the app becomes active, the completion block won't need to make a network request in most cases.

### Checking If A User Is Subscribed

The subscription status for a user can easily be determined with the `CustomerInfo` and `EntitlementInfo` objects.

For most apps that only have one entitlement, the `isActive` status can be quickly checked for your entitlement ID.

import content9 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_9.swift";
import content10 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_10.m";
import content11 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_11.kt";
import content12 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_12.java";
import content13 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_13.js";
import content14 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_14.js";
import content15 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_15.js";
import content16 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_16.cs";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "swift",
      content: content9,
    },
    {
      type: "objc",
      content: content10,
    },
    {
      type: "kotlin",
      content: content11,
    },
    {
      type: "java",
      content: content12,
    },
    {
      type: "flutter",
      content: content13,
    },
    {
      type: "rn",
      content: content14,
    },
    {
      type: "cordova",
      content: content15,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      content: content16,
    },
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: rcBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Check for specific entitlement",
    },
  ]}
/>

If your app has multiple entitlements, you might also want to check if the customer has any active entitlements:

import content17 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_17.swift";
import content18 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_18.m";
import content19 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_19.kt";
import content20 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_20.java";
import content21 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_21.js";
import content22 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_22.js";
import content23 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_23.js";
import content24 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_24.cs";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "swift",
      content: content17,
    },
    {
      type: "objc",
      content: content18,
    },
    {
      type: "kotlin",
      content: content19,
    },
    {
      type: "java",
      content: content20,
    },
    {
      type: "flutter",
      content: content21,
    },
    {
      type: "rn",
      content: content22,
    },
    {
      type: "cordova",
      content: content23,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      content: content24,
    },
    {
      type: "ts",
      content: rcBillingContent,
      name: "Web (JS/TS)",
      region: "Check for any entitlement",
    },
  ]}
/>

It's important to note that CustomerInfo will be empty if no purchases have been made and no transactions have been synced. This means that entitlements may not exist in CustomerInfo even if they have been set up in the RevenueCat dashboard.

### Restoring Purchases

Restoring purchases is a mechanism by which your user can restore their in-app purchases, reactivating any content that had previously been purchased from the same store account (Apple, Google, or Amazon).

It is recommended that all apps have some way for users to trigger the restorePurchases method, even if you require all customers to create accounts.

See our [Restoring Purchases](/getting-started/restoring-purchases) guide for more information.

### Cache

The SDK caches the user's subscription information to reduce your app's reliance on the network.

Users who unlock entitlements will be able to access them even without an internet connection. The SDK will update the cache if it's older than 5 minutes, but only if you call `getCustomerInfo()`, make a purchase, or restore purchases, so it's a good idea to call `getCustomerInfo()` any time a user accesses premium content.

### Listening For CustomerInfo Updates

Since _Purchases_ SDK works seamlessly on any platform, a user's CustomerInfo may change from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in CustomerInfo by conforming to an optional delegate method, `purchases:receivedUpdated:`. This will fire whenever we receive a _change_ in CustomerInfo _on the current device_ and you should expect it to be called at launch and throughout the life of the app.

CustomerInfo updates are not pushed to your app from the RevenueCat backend, updates can only happen from an outbound network request to RevenueCat.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to customer information the next time your app is launched. Or throughout your app as you request new `CustomerInfo` objects.

### Reference

<details>
<summary>CustomerInfo Reference</summary>

The `CustomerInfo` object gives you access to the following information about a user:

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Getting subscription status via the REST API

If you need to get a user's subscription status from outside of the _Purchases SDK_, for example, from your own backend, you should use the REST API. You can read the full API reference [here](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference).

import content33 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_33.curl";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "curl",
      content: content33,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Handling Refunds

RevenueCat can handle refunds across all platforms for both subscription and non-subscription products. As soon as RevenueCat detects a refund, the CustomerInfo will be updated to reflect the correct entitlement status - no action required on your part! If you have questions about refunds, take a look at our [community article](https://community.revenuecat.com/general-questions-7/how-do-i-issue-a-refund-115) covering the topic.

## Offline Entitlements

In the very uncommon case that RevenueCat servers don't respond as expected, the SDK is prepared to verify Apple/Google/Amazon's purchases on the device itself and grant entitlements temporarily. This allows your customers to have an almost seamless experience in this unlikely scenario, improving even more on our reliability. This happens automatically, so you don't need to do anything, the entitlements will appear in the `CustomerInfo`.

Offline Entitlements is automatically enabled when our SDK attempts to reach our servers and they can't respond. It automatically is disabled when our servers respond successful http responses again.

In order to do this, the SDK caches the relationships between products and entitlements you have setup in your RevenueCat dashboard. Then, when it tries to post a purchase to RevenueCat's servers, and these respond with an error, we will use the purchases from the stores and these relationships to grant entitlements.

### Some things to note:

- No information is lost when Offline Entitlements are active. All purchases are recorded and will be processed by our servers automatically once they are back online, with no action needed from you or your users.
- The data for these purchases won't appear in our RevenueCat graphs and webhooks until it's successfully pushed.
- Purchases won't be recognized cross-platform while using Offline Entitlements.
- Offline Entitlements only gets enabled if the user makes a purchases while RevenueCat's servers are down. Otherwise, it will use any existing cached information, which does consider cross-platform purchases.
- Offline Entitlements don't currently work for one-time purchases (consumables and non-consumables). If our SDK detects that the user has made one of these purchases, Offline Entitlements will not be enabled and an error will be returned instead.
- Offline Entitlements are disabled when [your app is completing transactions](/migrating-to-revenuecat/sdk-or-not/finishing-transactions).
