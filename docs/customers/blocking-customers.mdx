---

Fraudulent customers, or those that violate your app's Terms of Service, can be blocked in the RevenueCat dashboard.

This action is also useful if you accidentally hardcode an [App User ID](/customers/identifying-customers) into a released version of your app.

:::warning High-risk action
Blocking a customer will delete them in RevenueCat, preventing the customer from accessing your app's paid features. If the customer is a legitimate paying user, this action may violate app store policies and result in complaints, chargebacks, or enforcement against your app.

You may want to [delete a customer](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#delete-customer) instead.

## Blocking a Customer

To block a customer, go your project's Settings page in the dashboard and click on the **Blocked customers** tab.

### What blocking does

Blocking a customer deletes them in RevenueCat and prevents their App User ID from being used again. As a consequence, the customer will not be able to access your app's paid features.

Moreover, the customer's metadata, such as [Customer Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes), will be permanently lost.

Blocking a customer is a highly sensitive action and should only be done if you have verified the customer has a fraudulent subscription or has violated your app's Terms of Service. Failure to do so may result in complaints or enforcement against your app by the app stores.

To mitigate the risk of blocking a customer from their purchase, you should [refund their purchase](/subscription-guidance/refunds) before blocking them.

:::info App Store purchases
You cannot manage Apple's App Store purchases in RevenueCat.

## Unblocking a Customer

To unblock a customer, simply click the **Unblock** button in the blocked customer's row.

![unblock customer button](/docs_images/customers/unblock-customer-button.png)

The customer will be unblocked and recreated in RevenueCat.

Customer metadata, such as [Customer Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes), will be reset to their default values. If the customer has active purchases, they can [Restore Purchases](/getting-started/restoring-purchases) to regain access.
