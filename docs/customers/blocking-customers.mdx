You can block fraudulent customers, or those that violate your app's Terms of Service, in the RevenueCat dashboard.

This action is also useful if you accidentally hardcoded an [App User ID](/customers/identifying-customers) into a released version of your app.

:::warning High-risk action
Blocking a customer will delete them in RevenueCat, preventing the customer from accessing your app's paid features. If the customer is a legitimate paying user, this action may violate app store policies and result in complaints, chargebacks, or enforcement against your app.

## Blocking a Customer

To block a customer, go your project's Settings page in the dashboard and click on the **Blocked customers** tab.

Click the **Block customer** button to confirm the action.

The customer will be blocked and will no longer be able to access your app's paid features.

:::info Blocked customers limit
You can block up to 100 customers from your project.

## Unblocking a Customer

To unblock a customer, simply click the **Unblock** button in the blocked customer's row.

The customer will be unblocked and recreated in RevenueCat.

Customer metadata, such as [Customer Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes), will be reset to their default values. If the customer has active purchases, they can [Restore Purchases](/getting-started/restoring-purchases) to regain access.
