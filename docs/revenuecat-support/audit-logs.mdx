Audit Logs provide a detailed record of notable actions performed by users of the projects for which you are an administrator. These logs can be used for identifying the source of changes in your projects as well as for internal and external compliance.

## Content

- **Timestamp:** The time at which the event occurred.
- **Action:** The type of action performed (e.g., `user_signed_in`).
- **Actor:** The entity that performed the action (e.g., user, API key).
- **Target:** The main entity affected by the action (e.g., product).
- **Additional Data:** Additional key-value pairs providing further details about the actor, target, and any other metadata associated with the event.
