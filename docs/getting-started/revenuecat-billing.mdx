:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat Billing and the RevenueCat Web SDK are currently in beta.
:::
## Introduction
RevenueCat Billing and the Web SDK allow you to easily offer web subscriptions. The feature is currently in beta and has a number of known limitations. Most notably:

* Only USD is currently supported (multi-currency support will follow later)
* Only subscriptions are currently supported, no one-time purchases
* There is no support for sales tax or VAT calculation
* There is no support for trials, discounts, or other offers
* There is no support for our Paywall templates yet

Currently, RevenueCat Billing supports using Stripe as the payment gateway. This differs from our [Stripe Billing / Stripe Checkout](/getting-started/stripe) integration in that RevenueCat Billing takes care of the purchase UI, the subscription management portal, and the recurring billing logic. Stripe will still charge a [payment processing fee](https://stripe.com/pricing) if you use RevenueCat Billing, but you will not have to pay [Stripe Billing / Checkout fees](https://stripe.com/billing/pricing). 

## Installation

Start by installing the `@revenuecat/purchases-js` package using the package manager of your choice:

import npmContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/installation-npm.shell";
import yarnContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/installation-yarn.shell";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'shell', content: npmContent, name: 'npm' },
    { type: 'shell', content: yarnContent, name: 'yarn' }
]} />

## General setup

To get started with the Web SDK, you should follow the regular setup of [entitlements, products, and offerings](/getting-started/entitlements). In contrast to eg. Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Stripe Billing products, you don't need to go somewhere else to configure your product and its duration and pricing, you can do that [right in the RevenueCat dashboard](/getting-started/entitlements/rc-billing-products):

## SDK configuration

You configure the RevenueCat Web SDK by creating a new instance of the `Purchases` class:

import tsContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/configuring-sdk.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsContent, name: "JS / TS" },
]} />

Ideally, you should configure the SDK only once in your code, and then reuse the object across your code. This will avoid making extraneous API calls to the RevenueCat SDK.

## Identifying customers

In contrast to our mobile SDKs, the Web SDK currently supports only [identified (non-anonymous) customers](/customers/user-ids). There are two reasons for this limitation:
1. In contrast to mobile app stores, there is no "restore purchase" functionality linked to a store account of the customer. Therefore, an anonymous purchase might get lost if the customer reloads their browser or clears their cache/cookies. 
2. It is not possible to write a secure web application completely without a backend, since it is easily possible for a malicious actor to manipulate the state of the application through the browser's developer tools. Therefore, any web app using RevenueCat Billing to manage subscriptions also needs a backend component to check for access, which requires a shared customer ID. 

In practice, this means setting up an authentication / login mechanism, for example, using a third party authentication provider like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) / [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) or a library like [auth.js](https://authjs.dev/). The added benefit of this is that using a shared authentication mechanism between web app and mobile apps allows customers to access their subscriptions they made on the web in the mobile app as well, without any additional configuration (other than adding the products to the correct entitlements).

## Getting customer information

You can access the customer information using the `getCustomerInfo()` method of the `Purchases` object:

import tsGettingCustomerInformation from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/getting-customer-information.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsGettingCustomerInformation, name: "Web (JS/TS)" },
]} />

You can then use the `entitlements` property of the `CustomerInfo` object to check whether the customer has access to a specific entitlement:

import tsCheckForSpecificEntitlement from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/check-for-specific-entitlement.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsCheckForSpecificEntitlement, name: "Web (JS/TS)" },
]} />

If your app has multiple entitlements, you might also want to check if the customer has any active entitlements:

import tsCheckForAnyEntitlement from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/check-for-any-entitlement.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsCheckForAnyEntitlement, name: "Web (JS/TS)" },
]} />

## Building your paywall

### Getting and displaying products

We recommend using [Offerings](/getting-started/entitlements#offerings) to configure which products get presented to the customer. You can access the offerings for a given app user ID with the (asynchronous) method `purchases.getOfferings()`. The current offering for the customer is contained in the `current` property of the return value. 

import tsCurrentOffering from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/current-offering.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsCurrentOffering, name: "Web (JS/TS)" },
]} />

It's also possible to access other Offerings besides the Current Offering directly by its identifier.

import rcBillingCustomOffering from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/custom-offering.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: rcBillingCustomOffering, name: 'Web (TS/JS)' },
]} />

Each Offering contains a list of Packages. Packages can be access in a few different ways:

1. via the `.availablePackages` property on an Offering.
2. via the duration convenience property on an Offering
3. via the `.packagesById` property of an Offering, keyed by the package identifier

import tsDisplayingPackages from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/displaying-packages.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsDisplayingPackages, name: 'Web (JS/TS)' },
]} />

Each Package contains information about the product in the `rcBillingProduct` property:

import tsGettingProduct from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/getting-product.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsGettingProduct, name: 'Web (JS/TS)' },
]} />

### Purchasing a package

To purchase a package, use the `purchasePackage()` method of the `Purchases` object. It returns a `Promise<{customerInfo: CustomerInfo}>`. To handle errors, you should catch any exceptions that occur.

import tsPurchasingPackage from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/purchasing-package.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsPurchasingPackage, name: 'Web (JS/TS)' },
]} />


### An example end-to-end implementation

Here are some end-to-end examples for how a full skeleton paywall might look like:

import tsDisplayingProducts from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/displaying-products.ts";
import reactDisplayingProducts from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/displaying-products.tsx";
import svelteDisplayingProducts from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/rc-billing/displaying-products.svelte";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'ts', content: tsDisplayingProducts, name: "Web (JS/TS)" },
    { type: 'tsx', content: reactDisplayingProducts, name: "React" },
    { type: 'svelte', content: svelteDisplayingProducts, name: "Svelte" },
]} />
