If this is your first time integrating RevenueCat into your app, we recommend following our [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

## Initialization

Once you've [installed](/getting-started/installation) the SDK for your app, it's time to initialize and configure it.

You should only configure _Purchases_ once, usually early in your application lifecycle. After configuration, the same instance is shared throughout your app by accessing the `.shared` instance in the SDK.

Make sure you configure _Purchases_ with your public SDK key only. You can read more about the different API keys available in our [Authentication guide](/projects/authentication).

**Note:** If you're using a hybrid SDK, such as React Native or Flutter, you'll need to initialize the SDK with a separate API key for each platform (i.e., iOS and Android). The keys can be found in the RevenueCat dashboard under **Project Settings > API keys > App specific keys**.

## Enabling Debug Logs

Be sure to enable and view debug logs while implementing the SDK and testing your app. Debug logs contain important information about what's happening behind the scenes and should be the first thing you check if your app is behaving unexpectedly.

As detailed in the sample code above, debug logs can be enabled or disabled by setting the `Purchases.logLevel` property before configuring _Purchases_.

Debug logs will provide detailed log output in Xcode or LogCat for what is going on behind the scenes and should be the first thing you check if your app is behaving unexpectedly, and also to confirm there aren't any unhandled warnings or errors.

## Testing with Test Store

After configuring the SDK, you're ready to start testing with your Test Store products. **No additional configuration is required**—the SDK automatically works with Test Store.

**Benefits of testing with Test Store:**

- ✅ **Immediate testing** - Start making test purchases right after SDK initialization
- ✅ **No platform dependencies** - Works without App Store Connect or Google Play Console setup
- ✅ **Perfect for early development** - Test your complete purchase flow before platform configuration
- ✅ **Works everywhere** - Ideal for Expo, web apps, and other environments without native store APIs

The SDK automatically fetches Test Store products through your configured offerings. Test purchases behave just like real subscriptions in your app—they update `CustomerInfo`, trigger entitlement checks, and appear in your RevenueCat dashboard.

When you're ready to connect real stores for production, the SDK seamlessly transitions to fetching products from the App Store, Google Play, or other platforms based on your configuration. No code changes needed.

## Additional Configuration

The SDK allows additional configuration on first setup:

- **API Key (required)**: The public API key that corresponds to your app, found via **Project Settings > API keys > App specific keys** in the RevenueCat dashboard.
- **App User ID (optional)**: An identifier for the current user. Pass `null` if you don't have a user identifier at the time of configuration, RevenueCat will generate an anonymous App User ID for you. See our [guide on identifying users](/customers/user-ids) for more information.
- **Purchases Completed By (optional)**: A boolean value to tell RevenueCat not to [complete purchases](/migrating-to-revenuecat/sdk-or-not/finishing-transactions). Only set purchase completion to your app if you have your own code handling purchases.
- **User Defaults (optional, iOS only)**: A key to override the standard user defaults used to cache `CustomerInfo`. This is required if you need to access `CustomerInfo` in an [iOS App Extension](https://developer.apple.com/app-extensions/).

### Proxies & configuration for users in Mainland China

We’ve received reports of our API being blocked in mainland China.

While we work on a long-term solution, if your app has a significant user base in this region, set the `proxyURL` property to `https://api.rc-backup.com/` before initializing the RevenueCat SDK. Ensure this configuration occurs prior to SDK setup to prevent connection issues for users in mainland China.

:::caution If you already have a proxy server
If you have your own proxy server and already use the `proxyURL` API, you don't need any further configuration.

### iOS

#### Listening for CustomerInfo updates

:::info Note
RevenueCat doesn't push new data to the SDK, so this method is only called when CustomerInfo is updated from another SDK method or after a purchase is made on the current device.
:::

Implement the following delegate method to receive updates to the `CustomerInfo` object:

```
purchases:receivedUpdated
```

Called whenever _Purchases_ receives an updated `CustomerInfo` object. This may happen periodically throughout the life of the app if new information becomes available (e.g. after making a purchase).

#### Handling Promoted Purchases

Implement the following delegate method to handle promoted purchases:

```
purchases:readyForPromotedProduct
```

Called when a user initiates a promoted in-app purchase from the App Store. If your app is able to handle a purchase at the current time, run the `defermentBlock` in this method.

If the app is not in a state to make a purchase: cache the `defermentBlock`, then call the `defermentBlock` when the app is ready to make the promoted purchase.

If the purchase should never be made, you don't need to ever call the `defermentBlock` and _Purchases_ will not proceed with promoted purchases.

### Android

#### Listening for CustomerInfo updates

:::info Note
RevenueCat doesn't push new data to the SDK, so this method is only called when CustomerInfo is updated from another SDK method or after a purchase is made on the current device.
:::

Implement the following listener to receive updates to the `CustomerInfo` object:

```
UpdatedCustomerInfoListener
```

Called whenever _Purchases_ receives an updated `CustomerInfo` object. This may happen periodically throughout the life of the app if new information becomes available (e.g. after making a purchase).

## Next steps

Once you've configured the SDK, you're ready to set up your products:

- **Start with Test Store** (recommended): Your project already has a Test Store provisioned. [Create test products](/docs/offerings/products-overview) and start testing immediately.
- **Connect real stores**: When you're ready for production, [configure your products](/docs/offerings/products-overview) in App Store Connect, Google Play Console, or other platforms.
