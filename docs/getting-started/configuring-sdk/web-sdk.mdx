After you have [installed](/getting-started/installation/web-sdk) the RevenueCat Web SDK, you can configure it in your code by creating a new instance of the `Purchases` class:

import tsContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/configuring-sdk/rc-billing-1.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'js', content: tsContent, name: 'JS' },
]} />
