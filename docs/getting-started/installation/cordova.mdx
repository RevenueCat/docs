## What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app/) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

:::danger The Cordova SDK is deprecated
The Cordova SDK is now deprecated. We suggest using our [Capacitor SDK](/docs/getting-started/installation/capacitor) instead. 

The Cordova SDK will receive maintainence updates, but new RevenueCat features and new major versions will not be made available. Because this SDK uses Billing Client v6, Google will not allow updates to your app after August 31st, 2025.

## Installation

import content from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/cordova_1.shell";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'shell', content: content, name: 'Installation' }
]} />

## Additional iOS Setup

### Add In-app Purchase Capability to Project
The In-app Purchase capability isn't required to install the SDK, but it is required to make purchases.
1. In Xcode, in project manager, select your app target.
2. Open the `Signing and Capabilities` tab.
3. Click the `+ Capability` button and double-click on In-App Purchase.

### Add Strip Frameworks Phase if using cordova-plugin-purchases 1.1.0 or lower

The App Store, in its infinite wisdom, still rejects fat frameworks, so we need to strip our framework before it is deployed. To do this, add the following script phase to your build.
1. In Xcode, in project manager, select your app target.
2. Open the `Build Phases` tab
3. Add a new `Run Script`, name it `Strip Frameworks`
4. Add the following command `"${PROJECT_DIR}/../../node_modules/cordova-plugin-purchases/src/ios/strip-frameworks.sh"` (quotes included)

### Set `SWIFT_LANGUAGE_VERSION`

You have to make sure that the `SWIFT_LANGUAGE_VERSION` is set if it's not already. `cordova-plugin-purchases` needs Swift >= 5.0.

You can either set it in the project yourself, or use an external plugin like https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-add-swift-support.
In order to set it yourself:
1. In Xcode, in project manager, select your app target.
2. Open the `Build Settings` tab
3. Look for the `Swift Language Version` setting.
4. Set it to 5.0.

## Import Purchases

## TypeScript

The types are shipped inside the npm package. You can import them like this:

import cordovaTypesContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/ionic_typescript_cordova.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'cordova', content: cordovaTypesContent, name: 'Cordova Typescript types' }
]} />

## Angular

Wait for the Platform to be ready, then configure the plugin in your `src/app/app.component.ts`:

import cordovaAngularContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/ionic_angular_cordova.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'cordova', content: cordovaAngularContent, name: 'Cordova' }
]} />

## React

Import the plugin object then use its static methods:

import cordovaReactContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/ionic_react_cordova.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'cordova', content: cordovaReactContent, name: 'Cordova' }
]} />

## Next Steps

* Now that you've installed the Purchases SDK in your Cordova app, get started by [initializing an instance of Purchases â†’](/getting-started/quickstart#4-using-revenuecats-purchases-sdk)
