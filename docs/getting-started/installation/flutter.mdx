## What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app/) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

## Requirements

Xcode 13.3.1+
Minimum target: iOS 11.0+

## Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/releases)

To use this plugin, add `purchases_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/) (and run an implicit dart pub get):

import content from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/flutter_1.yaml";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "yaml", content: content, name: "YAML" }]} />

Alternatively run this command:

```
 $ flutter pub add purchases_flutter
```

### iOS Deployment Target

RevenueCat is compatible with iOS 11.0 or higher. Flutter does not automatically set the iOS deployment target for your project. You need to make sure that the deployment target is set to 11.0 or higher. To do that, simply edit `ios/Podfile` and add the following line if it's not already there:

```
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

Set it to 11.0 or a higher version for RevenueCat to work.

### iOS Swift Version

RevenueCat requires Swift >= 5.0 to work. If the `Podfile` in your project's `ios` folder specifies a Swift version, make sure that it's at least 5.0, otherwise you may run into build issues.

### Set the correct launchMode for Android

Depending on your user's payment method, they may be asked by Google Play to verify their purchase in their (banking) app. This means they will have to background your app and go to another app to verify the purchase. If your Activity's `launchMode` is set to anything other than `standard` or `singleTop`, backgrounding your app can cause the purchase to get cancelled. To avoid this, set the `launchMode` of your Activity to `standard` or `singleTop` in your Android app's `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

import launchModeContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_launchmode.xml";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "xml", content: launchModeContent, name: "AndroidManifest.xml" },
  ]}
/>

You can find Android's documentation on the various `launchMode` options [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#lmode).

### Optional: Change MainActivity subclass

If you plan to use [RevenueCat Paywalls](/tools/paywalls), your `MainActivity` needs to subclass `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`.

import flutterMainActivity from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/flutter_mainactivity.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "MainActivity.kt",
      content: flutterMainActivity,
      name: "MainActivity.kt",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `purchases_flutter`.

import content2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/flutter_2.kt";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "flutter", content: content2, name: "Dart" }]} />

      content: reactNativeXmlContent,
      name: "AndroidManifest.xml",
    },
  ]}
/>

:::warning
If you're using other plugins like [mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx), you may run into conflicts with types from other plugins having the same name as those defined in `purchases_flutter`.<br/>
If this happens, you can resolve the ambiguity in the types by adding an import alias, for example:

```dart
import 'package:purchases_flutter/purchases_flutter.dart' as purchases;
```

After that, you can reference the types from `purchases_flutter` as `purchases.Foo`, like `purchases.PurchaserInfo`.
