## What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app/) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

## Android

### Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-android.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases)

Purchases for Android (Google Play and Amazon Appstore) is available on Maven and can be included via Gradle.

import buildGradle1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_4.kts";
import buildGradle2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_1.groovy";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
      { type: "kotlin", content: buildGradle1, name: "kts" },
      { type: "groovy", content: buildGradle2, name: "groovy" },
    ]}
/>

### Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `Purchases`.

import kotlinContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_5.kt";
import javaContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_2.java";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
      { type: "kotlin", content: kotlinContent, name: "kotlin" },
      { type: "java", content: javaContent, name: "java" },
    ]}
/>

### Configure Proguard (Optional)

We are adding Proguard rules to the library so you don't need to do anything. If you have any issues finding classes in our SDK, try adding `-keep class com.revenuecat.purchases.** { *; }` to your Proguard configuration.

:::warning
Purchases uses AndroidX App Startup under the hood. Make sure you have not removed the `androidx.startup.InitializationProvider` completely in your manifest. If you need to remove specific initializers, such as `androidx.work.WorkManagerInitializer`, set `tools:node="merge"` on the provider, and `tools:node="remove"` on the meta-data of the initializer you want to remove.

import xmlContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_workmanager_manifest.xml";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "xml", content: xmlContent, name: "AndroidManifest.xml" }]}
/>
:::

### Set the correct launchMode

Depending on your user's payment method, they may be asked by Google Play to verify their purchase in their (banking) app. This means they will have to background your app and go to another app to verify the purchase. If your Activity's `launchMode` is set to anything other than `standard` or `singleTop`, backgrounding your app can cause the purchase to get cancelled. To avoid this, set the `launchMode` of your Activity to `standard` or `singleTop` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, like so:

import launchModeContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_launchmode.xml";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "xml", content: launchModeContent, name: "AndroidManifest.xml" },
  ]}
/>

You can find Android's documentation on the various `launchMode` options [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#lmode).

## Amazon

### Additional Dependencies

Add a new dependency to the build.gradle apart from the regular `purchases` dependency. These new dependencies have the classes needed to use Amazon IAP:

import amazonGradle1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_6.kts";
import amazonGradle2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_3.groovy";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
      { type: "kotlin", content: amazonGradle1, name: "kts" },
      { type: "groovy", content: amazonGradle2, name: "groovy" },
    ]}
/>

### Add Amazon public key

Adding support for Amazon requires adding a `.pem` public key to your project. You can configure this key by following Amazon's guide [here](https://developer.amazon.com/es/docs/in-app-purchasing/integrate-appstore-sdk.html#configure_key).

Due to some limitations, RevenueCat will only validate purchases made in production or in Live App Testing and won't validate purchases made with the Amazon App Tester.

## Next Steps
