## What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app/) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

## Android

### Installation

Purchases for Android (Google Play and Amazon Appstore) is available on Maven and can be included via Gradle.

You can find the latest version below, and for more details, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases).

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/RevenueCat/purchases-android.svg?&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases)

import buildGradle1 from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_4.kts?raw";
import buildGradle2 from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_1.groovy?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: buildGradle1, name: "Kotlin" },
    { type: "groovy", content: buildGradle2, name: "Groovy" },
  ]}
/>

### Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `Purchases`.

import kotlinContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_5.kt?raw";
import javaContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_2.java?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: kotlinContent, name: "Kotlin" },
    { type: "java", content: javaContent, name: "Java" },
  ]}
/>

### Configure Proguard (Optional)

We are adding Proguard rules to the library so you don't need to do anything. If you have any issues finding classes in our SDK, try adding `-keep class com.revenuecat.purchases.** { *; }` to your Proguard configuration.

:::warning
Purchases uses AndroidX App Startup under the hood. Make sure you have not removed the `androidx.startup.InitializationProvider` completely in your manifest. If you need to remove specific initializers, such as `androidx.work.WorkManagerInitializer`, set `tools:node="merge"` on the provider, and `tools:node="remove"` on the meta-data of the initializer you want to remove.

import xmlContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_workmanager_manifest.xml?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "xml", content: xmlContent, name: "AndroidManifest.xml" }]}
/>

### Backup RevenueCat data / Proactive restores (Experimental/Optional)

When a user uninstalls and reinstalls or changes devices, unless you are using your own account system, you must provide a restore purchases button somewhere in your app so users can recover any previously performed purchases. RevenueCat provides an easy to use `restorePurchases` method in our SDKs to do this. However, some customers might run into difficulties with this process. In these cases, Google provides some mechanisms to perform backups of your app's contents so they are available when your users move to new devices, or uninstall and reinstall within the same device. This might require some setup to make sure the backup include RevenueCat information correctly.

:::note
Making sure your backup setup is correctly configured is highly recommended for developers that don't use an account system that allow users to sign up/sign in to recover their data.
:::

:::warning
We highly recommend developers that do not have an account system and that have/had non-consumable products configured as consumables in the RevenueCat dashboard to configure this correctly.
This will help minimize the effects of Google removing the capability of querying for consumed one time products in the Google Play Billing Library 8, which could cause issues of losing these purchases forever.
:::

There are 2 recommended approaches you can take to perform backups, [Auto Backup](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/autobackup) and [Key-value backups](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/keyvaluebackup). 
In either case, we recommend you make sure to include your app's default SharedPreferences file and RevenueCat's SharedPreferences file (You can find the name of this SharedPreferences file by doing `RevenueCatBackupAgent.REVENUECAT_PREFS_FILE_NAME`) in the files you backup. 

#### Auto Backup
Auto Backup is enabled by default in your apps. This backs up most of your app content, including the RevenueCat relevant SharedPreferences files up to a 25MB limit, at which point, it stops doing backups. You can configure what you want to backup following [the official documentation](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/autobackup#IncludingFiles). 

We recommend adjusting the files you want to back up to make sure you don't go over the limit and making sure the SharedPreferences files are included.

#### Key-Value backups
Please note that doing this will disable Auto backup and will just back up RevenueCat files!

If you prefer to disable auto-backup and just copy the RevenueCat SharedPreferences file, you may optionally use our provided `RevenueCatBackupAgent` to perform a backup of the relevant files. To do this, you need to add to your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` `<application>` node a property like this:

```xml
android:backupAgent="com.revenuecat.purchases.backup.RevenueCatBackupAgent"
```

That's it!

#### How to test backups
Whether you're using Auto Backup or Key-Value backups, Google provides some documentation on how to test backups and restores [in their documentation](https://developer.android.com/identity/data/testingbackup).

One thing to note, however, is that these backups are not guaranteed to work across all devices and might require factory resets in the target device to use the backup.

### Set the correct launchMode

Depending on your user's payment method, they may be asked by Google Play to verify their purchase in their (banking) app. This means they will have to background your app and go to another app to verify the purchase. If your Activity's `launchMode` is set to anything other than `standard` or `singleTop`, backgrounding your app can cause the purchase to get cancelled. To avoid this, set the `launchMode` of your Activity to `standard` or `singleTop` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, like so:

import launchModeContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_launchmode.xml?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "xml", content: launchModeContent, name: "AndroidManifest.xml" },
  ]}
/>

You can find Android's documentation on the various `launchMode` options [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#lmode).

## Amazon

### Additional Dependencies

Add a new dependency to the `build.gradle` apart from the regular `purchases` dependency. These new dependencies have the classes needed to use Amazon IAP:

You can find the latest version below, and for more details, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases).

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/RevenueCat/purchases-android.svg?&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases)

import amazonGradle1 from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_6.kts?raw";
import amazonGradle2 from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_3.groovy?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: amazonGradle1, name: "Kotlin" },
    { type: "groovy", content: amazonGradle2, name: "Groovy" },
  ]}
/>

### Add Amazon public key

Adding support for Amazon requires adding a `.pem` public key to your project. You can configure this key by following Amazon's guide [here](https://developer.amazon.com/es/docs/in-app-purchasing/integrate-appstore-sdk.html#configure_key).

Due to some limitations, RevenueCat will only validate purchases made in production or in Live App Testing and won't validate purchases made with the Amazon App Tester.
