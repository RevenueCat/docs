With the RevenueCat Web SDK and our Web Billing (formerly RevenueCat Billing) engine, you can easily implement subscriptions in your web app or build a web subscription page for your mobile app. RevenueCat handles the recurring billing logic, manages what entitlements customers have access to, and automatically recovers payments in the case of billing issues. Web Billing uses Stripe as a trusted payment gateway and supports all payment methods supported by Stripe.
