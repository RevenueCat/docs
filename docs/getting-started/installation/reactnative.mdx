## What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and a wrapper around StoreKit and Google Play Billing to make implementing in-app purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

## Installation

Make sure that the deployment target for iOS is least 13.4 and Android is at least 6.0 (API 23) [as defined here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#-requirements). 

### Option 1: React-Native package

Purchases for React-Native can be installed either via npm or yarn.
We recommend using the latest version of React Native, or making sure that the version is at least greater than 0.64. 

#### Option 1.1: Using auto-linking

Recent versions of React Native will automatically link the SDK, so all that's needed is to install the library.

import reactNativeNpmContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_1.shell";
import reactNativeYarnContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_2.shell";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'shell', content: reactNativeNpmContent, name: 'npm' },
    { type: 'shell', content: reactNativeYarnContent, name: 'yarn' }
]} />

#### Option 1.2: Manual linking

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'shell', content: reactNativeNpmContent, name: 'npm' },
    { type: 'shell', content: reactNativeYarnContent, name: 'yarn' }
]} />

After that, you should link the library to the native projects by doing:

import reactNativeShellContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_5.shell";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'shell', content: reactNativeShellContent, name: 'Shell' }
]} />

### Option 2: Using Expo

`react-native-purchases` works with with any Expo project when using a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds). A development build helps you iterate as quickly as possible and provides a more flexible, reliable, and complete development environment. It also enables you to only write JavaScript/TypeScript while letting Expo tools and services take care of everything else. The Android and iOS apps are built using Expo's build service and generate development and production binaries for testing and releasing.

As of mid 2021, projects created with Expo now support in-app payments and are compatible with `react-native-purchases`. Running `npx expo install react-native-purchases` is all that needs to be done before you can start implementing RevenueCat into your app.

Note: Expo's docs state that in-app purchases will only work on real Android and iOS devices which can make debugging more difficult. You can view the RevenueCat debug logs on Android with LogCat and iOS with Console.app.

For more information, see our blog post [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/in-app-puchase-expo-managed-workflow/).

#### Bare workflow

If you are using [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview/) (that is, your project is created using `react-native init`), [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) into your project and [leverage Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/using-expo-cli/) to use Expo tooling and services.

The bare workflow gives developers complete native control but also allows the use of Expo libraries and services. The bare workflow is similar to a project you would get from `npx react-native init`.

If you're planning on ejecting from Expo to use the bare workflow, upgrade your Expo version first, _then_ eject. It'll save you a whole lot of hassle.

Get started with the bare workflow [here](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview/).

## Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `Purchases`.

import reactNativeJsContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_7.js";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'rn', content: reactNativeJsContent}
]} />

:::info Include BILLING permission for Android projects
Don't forget to include the `BILLING` permission in your AndroidManifest.xml file
:::

import reactNativeXmlContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_8.xml";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    { type: 'xml', content: reactNativeXmlContent, name: 'AndroidManifest.xml' }
]} />

:::info Enable In-App Purchase capability for your iOS project
Don't forget to enable the In-App Purchase capability for your project under `Project Target -> Capabilities -> In-App Purchase`
