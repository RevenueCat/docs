## What is RevenueCat?

RevenueCat provides a backend and SDKs that wrap StoreKit, Google Play Billing, and [RevenueCat Web Billing](/web/web-billing/overview) to make implementing in-app and web purchases and subscriptions easy. With our SDK, you can build and manage your app business on any platform without having to maintain IAP infrastructure. You can read more about [how RevenueCat fits into your app](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/where-does-revenuecat-fit-in-your-app) or you can [sign up free](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) to start building.

## Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/releases)

Make sure that the deployment target for iOS is at least 13.4 and Android is at least 6.0 (API 23) [as defined here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#-requirements).

### React Native package

Purchases for React Native can be installed either via npm or yarn.

We recommend using the latest version of React Native, or making sure that the version is at least greater than 0.64.

#### Option 1.1: Using auto-linking

Recent versions of React Native will automatically link the SDK, so all that's needed is to install the library.

import reactNativeNpmContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_1.shell?raw";
import reactNativeYarnContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_2.shell?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "shell", content: reactNativeNpmContent, name: "npm" },
    { type: "shell", content: reactNativeYarnContent, name: "yarn" },
  ]}
/>

#### Option 1.2: Manual linking

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "shell", content: reactNativeNpmContent, name: "npm" },
    { type: "shell", content: reactNativeYarnContent, name: "yarn" },
  ]}
/>

After that, you should link the library to the native projects by doing:

import reactNativeShellContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_5.shell?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "shell", content: reactNativeShellContent, name: "Shell" }]}
/>

### Using Expo

Use Expo to rapidly iterate on your app by using JavaScript/TypeScript exclusively, while letting Expo take care of everything else.

See [Using RevenueCat with Expo](/getting-started/installation/expo) to get started.

### Set the correct launchMode for Android

Depending on your user's payment method, they may be asked by Google Play to verify their purchase in their (banking) app. This means they will have to background your app and go to another app to verify the purchase. If your Activity's `launchMode` is set to anything other than `standard` or `singleTop`, backgrounding your app can cause the purchase to get cancelled. To avoid this, set the `launchMode` of your Activity to `standard` or `singleTop` in your Android app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, like so:

import launchModeContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/android_launchmode.xml?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "xml", content: launchModeContent, name: "AndroidManifest.xml" },
  ]}
/>

You can find Android's documentation on the various `launchMode` options [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#lmode).

## Import Purchases

You should now be able to import `Purchases`.

import reactNativeJsContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_7.js.txt?raw";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "rn", content: reactNativeJsContent }]} />

:::info Include BILLING permission for Android projects
Don't forget to include the `BILLING` permission in your AndroidManifest.xml file
:::

import reactNativeXmlContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_8.xml?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "xml",
      content: reactNativeXmlContent,
      name: "AndroidManifest.xml",
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info Enable In-App Purchase capability for your iOS project
Don't forget to enable the In-App Purchase capability for your project under `Project Target -> Capabilities -> In-App Purchase`
:::

## Android Build Issues

### R8 Dependencies Conflict

If you encounter build failures related to R8 (Android's code shrinker) when using `react-native-purchases-ui`, you may see errors like:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:mergeExtDexDevDebug'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:devDebugRuntimeClasspath'.
```

This issue occurs due to a bug in earlier versions of Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) that affects R8 dependency resolution. To fix this, add the following to your project-level `build.gradle` file (not `app/build.gradle`):

import androidBuildFixContent from "@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/reactnative_android_build_fix.gradle?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "gradle",
      content: androidBuildFixContent,
      name: "build.gradle (project level)",
    },
  ]}
/>

This solution forces the use of a specific R8 version that resolves the dependency conflicts. For more details, see the [Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/342522142#comment8).

## Next Steps

- Now that you've installed the Purchases SDK in your React Native app, get started by [initializing an instance of Purchases →](/getting-started/quickstart#3-using-revenuecats-purchases-sdk)
