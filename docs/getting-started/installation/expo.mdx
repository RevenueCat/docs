Expo is a framework for building React Native apps. It's a popular choice for rapidly iterating on your app, while letting Expo take care of all the platform-specific code.

To use and test RevenueCat with Expo, you'll need to create an Expo development build. Follow the instructions below and learn more about Expo development builds [here](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

## Create an Expo development build

### Install Expo CLI and development dependencies

Start by installing [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/):

```
npm install expo -g
```

and then install [Expo DevClient](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/dev-client/):

```
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

### Get started with an Expo project

Either create a new Expo project with the following command:

```
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

or use an existing Expo project. Ensure you're in the project directory for the next steps:

```
cd <expo-project-directory>
```

### Install RevenueCat's SDKs

Install RevenueCat's `react-native-purchases` for core functionality and `react-native-purchases-ui` for UI components like [Paywalls](/docs/tools/paywalls-v2), [Customer Center](/docs/tools/customer-center), and more.

Either run:

```
npx expo install react-native-purchases react-native-purchases-ui
```

or update your package.json with the [latest package versions](https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/releases):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-purchases": "latest_version",
    "react-native-purchases-ui": "latest_version"
  }
}
```

### RevenueCat Dashboard Configuration

#### Configure a new project

RevenueCat projects are top-level containers for your apps, products, entitlements, paywalls, and more. If you don't already have a RevenueCat project for your app, [create one here](/docs/projects/overview).

#### Connect to a Store (Apple, Google, Web, etc.)

Depending on which platform you're building for, you'll need to connect your RevenueCat project to one, or multiple, stores. Set up your project's supported stores [here](/docs/projects/connect-a-store).

#### Add Products

For each store you're supporting, you'll need to add the products you plan on offering to your customers. Set up your products for each store [here](/docs/offerings/products/setup-index).

#### Create an Entitlement

An entitlement represents a level of access, features, or content that a customer is "entitled" to. When customers purchase a product, they're granted an entitlement. Create an entitlement [here](/docs/getting-started/entitlements). Then, [attach your products](/docs/getting-started/entitlements#attaching-products-to-entitlements) to your new entitlement.

#### Create an Offering

An offering is a collection of products that are "offered" to your customers on your paywall. Create an offering for your products [here](/docs/offerings/offerings/overview).

#### Configure a Paywall

A paywall is where your customers can purchase your products. RevenueCat's Paywalls allow you to remotely build and configure your paywall without any code changes or app updates. Create a paywall [here](/docs/tools/paywalls-v2).

### RevenueCat SDK Configuration

#### Initialize the SDK

Once you've installed the RevenueCat SDK, you'll need to configure it. Add the following code to the entry point of your app and be sure to replace `<revenuecat_project_platform_api_key>` with your [project's API keys](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/projects/authentication).

More information about configuring the SDK can be found [here](../configuring-sdk).

import expoContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/getting-started_6.ts";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "ts", content: expoContent, name: "Expo" }]} />

#### Identify a user and check subscription status

RevenueCat is the single source of truth for your customer's subscription status across all platforms. Learn more about the different ways to identify your customers to RevenueCat [here](/docs/customers/identifying-customers).

Then, [check the customer's subscription status](/docs/customers/customer-info) by fetching the [CustomerInfo object](/docs/customers/customer-info#:~:text=CustomerInfo%20Reference):

import content6 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_6.js";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "ts", content: content6, name: "Expo" }]} />

and inspecting the `entitlements` object to see if the customer is subscribed to your entitlement:

import content14 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/customers/customer-info_14.js";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "ts", content: content14, name: "Expo" }]} />

#### Present a paywall

If the customer is not subscribed to your entitlement, you can present a paywall to them where they can purchase your products.

There are several ways to present a paywall in Expo, each with different use cases, so please review the [React Native Paywalls documentation](/docs/tools/paywalls-v2/displaying-paywalls#react-native).

### Testing your app

To test, we'll use EAS to build the app for the simulator. You'll need to sign up at expo.dev and use the account below.

For more information about EAS, see the [EAS docs](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/eas/introduction/).

:::info
You can also follow these instructions on Expo's docs: https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/eas/configure-development-build/#initialize-a-development-build
:::

Get started by installing the EAS-CLI:

```
npm install -g eas-cli
```

Then login to EAS:

```
eas login
```

After logging in, initialize the EAS configuration:

```
eas init
```

The command will ask you to choose the platforms you want to build for.

You can read more about

#### Testing on iOS simulator

Next, you'll need to update `eas.json` with the simulator build profile [as described here](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/eas/ios-development-build-for-simulators/).

Your `eas.json` file might look like this:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 7.3.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {},
    "ios-simulator": {
      "extends": "development",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

`eas build --platform ios --profile ios-simulator`

Building creates a container app with your installed dependencies. Once the build completes and you run it on the device, the app will hot reload with your local changes during development

Enter bundle ID, matching RevenueCat config and App Store Connect

Open in simulator

`npx expo start`, choose the server in the iOS simulator

## Expo Go

Expo Go is not supported at this time.

`react-native-purchases` works with with any Expo project when using a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds). A development build helps you iterate as quickly as possible and provides a more flexible, reliable, and complete development environment. It also enables you to only write JavaScript/TypeScript while letting Expo tools and services take care of everything else. The Android and iOS apps are built using Expo's build service and generate development and production binaries for testing and releasing.

As of mid 2021, projects created with Expo now support in-app payments and are compatible with `react-native-purchases`. Running `npx expo install react-native-purchases` is all that needs to be done before you can start implementing RevenueCat into your app.

Note: Expo's docs state that in-app purchases will only work on real Android and iOS devices which can make debugging more difficult. You can view the RevenueCat debug logs on Android with LogCat and iOS with Console.app.

For more information, see our blog post [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/in-app-puchase-expo-managed-workflow/).

#### Bare workflow

If you are using [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview/) (that is, your project is created using `react-native init`), [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) into your project and [leverage Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/using-expo-cli/) to use Expo tooling and services.

The bare workflow gives developers complete native control but also allows the use of Expo libraries and services. The bare workflow is similar to a project you would get from `npx react-native init`.

If you're planning on ejecting from Expo to use the bare workflow, upgrade your Expo version first, _then_ eject. It'll save you a whole lot of hassle.

Get started with the bare workflow [here](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview/).
