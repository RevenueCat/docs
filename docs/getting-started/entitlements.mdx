There are three levels of product configuration available within RevenueCat, that are scoped to projects:

- Offerings, a remote-configurable group of products that is displayed to your users in a paywall
- Products, the individual SKUs that users actually purchase on each platform
- Entitlements, the level of access that users are entitled to after purchasing a product

The RevenueCat dashboard allows you to specify what level of access each product should unlock for your users, which can greatly simplify your in-app code to check for subscription access. 

The dashboard also allows you to configure which in-app products are shown to your users remotely, so you can control how they're presented without the need to update your app. This is great for experimenting how different product configurations affect key subscription metrics.

![An example of how products in Apple, Google, and Stripe translate to Products, Entitlements, and Offerings in RevenueCat.](/images/fb06e40-Screen_Shot_2020-07-01_at_6.12.53_PM_1af060245ecc584ec346645267c86b18.png)

The diagram above illustrates how products from Apple, Google, and Stripe would tie into RevenueCat. The configuration is explained in more detail below.

## Products

Products are the individual SKUs that users actually purchase. The stores (Apple, Google, Stripe, and Amazon) process these SKUs and charge the user.

### Store Configuration

No matter how you choose to use RevenueCat, you'll need to first have products set up in the stores. This is done outside of RevenueCat, and where you set things like price, duration, and free trials. If you've never set up products before or need a refresher (or tips and tricks) check out these guides:

- **[iOS / App Store Connect ](/getting-started/entitlements/ios-products)**
- **[Android / Google Play Console ](/getting-started/entitlements/android-products)**
- **[Android / Amazon Appstore ](/getting-started/entitlements/amazon-product-setup)**
- **[Stripe ](/getting-started/entitlements/stripe-products)**

### RevenueCat Configuration

After your products are set up in the stores, you'll also need to set up a 1-to-1 mapping of the products in RevenueCat as well.

Navigate to the **Products** tab in the settings for your project in the RevenueCat dashboard. To add a new product, click the **+ New** button and enter the product identifier **exactly as it appears in the store**, as well as the store that the product belongs to.

These product identifiers are the link between RevenueCat, and Apple, Google, Stripe, or Amazon.

After clicking "New", you also have the opportunity to directly import products for the following stores: Apple App Store, subscriptions from Google Play Store. Support for importing from other stores will be added in the future.

If you choose to set up subscription products manually for Google Play apps, you will need to add both the subscription ID and the base plan ID, which you can find in Google Play Console as per the following screenshot:

:::info
If a user purchases a product that has not been set up in RevenueCat, the purchase will still go through and be tracked in RevenueCat.
:::

To make it easier to identify your products in RevenueCat, you can optionally set a display name for them by:

1. Navigating to a product's configuration page
2. Clicking **Edit**
3. Entering your desired display name
4. Clicking **Save**

:::info
Product display names must be unique within an app. It's a good practice to include the product duration in the display name to avoid name overlaps, for example: 'My Pro Subscription Monthly', 'My Pro Subscription Yearly' etc".
:::

:::warning
Product display names are currently supported in Charts, and will be supported throughout the Dashboard in the near future.

## Next steps

If you've added your products in the dashboard, it's time to create an Entitlement.
