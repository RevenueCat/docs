Restoring purchases is a mechanism by which your user can restore their in-app purchases, reactivating any content that had previously been purchased **from the same store account** (Apple, Google, or Amazon).

It is recommended that all apps have some way for users to trigger the `restorePurchases` method, even if you require all customers to create accounts.

The `restorePurchases` method **should not** be triggered programmatically, since it may cause OS level sign-in prompts to appear, and should only be called from some user interaction (e.g. tapping a "Restore" button.)

:::warning
If you are trying to restore a purchase programmatically, use `syncPurchases` instead. This will not cause OS level sign-in prompts to appear.

## Restore behavior

When a user restores purchases that are already attached to another user, RevenueCat will decide whether to transfer the purchase to the new user based on the [transfer behavior](/projects/restore-behavior) setting.

## Syncing purchases without user interaction

`syncPurchases` is a method we provide in our SDK which allows you to programmatically trigger a restore. This method, much like restorePurchases, reactivates any content that had previously been purchased from the same store account (Apple, Google, or Amazon).

### Considerations

- `syncPurchases` is typically used for [migrating subscriptions](/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions)
- Since this method simulates restoring a purchase, there is a risk of transferring or aliasing an anonymous user

## Restoring Purchases for Consumables and Non-renewing Subscriptions

Consumables and non-renewing subscriptions can only be restored by using an acount system with custom [App User IDs](/customers/user-ids). This is due to these types of in-app purchases not showing up on the underlying store receipt after the transaction is finished.

By logging in your users with a custom App User ID, RevenueCat can continue to provide transaction details in a user's [CustomerInfo](/customers/customer-info) for their previous consumable and non-renewing subscription purchases.

## Considerations for enabling "Track New Purchases from Server-to-Server Notifications"

If you plan to enable the "Track new purchases from server-to-server notifications" feature ([Apple reference](/platform-resources/server-notifications/apple-server-notifications#tracking-new-purchases-using-apple-app-store-server-notifications), [Google reference](/platform-resources/server-notifications/google-server-notifications#tracking-new-purchases-using-google-cloud-pubsub)), please review your transfer behavior settings carefully. Enabling this feature may result in customers not receiving access to their entitlements if certain transfer settings are in place.
  
To ensure smooth functionality:
1. Confirm that you **are not** using the "Keep with original App User ID" or "Transfer if there are no active subscriptions" setting in combination with this feature, **or**
2. Check that you **are not** setting `appAccountToken` or `obfuscatedExternalAccountId` fields, **or**
3. Verify that any `appAccountToken` or `obfuscatedExternalAccountId` set for your customers will match their [RevenueCat App User ID](/customers/user-ids#logging-in-with-a-custom-app-user-id) **and** the app user ID is a valid UUID (RFC 4122 version 4).

If you meet any of the above conditions, you can proceed with enabling the feature. 

If not, it may happen that we first track a purchase for **App User ID A** from a server-to-server notification and later we receive the same purchase from the SDK or the REST API under a different **App User ID B**. In this case, no transfer will occur, and **App User ID B** will never get access to the entitlement. 

## Next Steps

- Make sure all purchases are being [linked to the correct user Id ](/customers/user-ids)
- If you're ready to test, start with our guides on [sandbox testing ](/test-and-launch/debugging)
