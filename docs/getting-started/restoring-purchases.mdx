Restoring purchases is a mechanism by which your user can restore their in-app purchases, reactivating any content that had previously been purchased **from the same store account** (Apple, Google, or Amazon).

It is recommended that all apps have some way for users to trigger the `restorePurchases` method, even if you require all customers to create accounts.

The `restorePurchases` method **should not** be triggered programmatically, since it may cause OS level sign-in prompts to appear, and should only be called from some user interaction (e.g. tapping a "Restore" button.)

:::warning
If you are trying to restore a purchase programmatically, use `syncPurchases` instead. This will not cause OS level sign-in prompts to appear.

## Restore behavior

When a user restores purchases that are already attached to another user, RevenueCat will decide whether to transfer the purchase to the new user based on the [transfer behavior](/projects/restore-behavior) setting.

## Syncing purchases without user interaction

`syncPurchases` is a method we provide in our SDK which allows you to programmatically trigger a restore. This method, much like restorePurchases, reactivates any content that had previously been purchased from the same store account (Apple, Google, or Amazon).

### Considerations

- `syncPurchases` is typically used for [migrating subscriptions](/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions)
- Since this method simulates restoring a purchase, there is a risk of transferring or aliasing an anonymous user

## Restoring Purchases for Consumables and Non-renewing Subscriptions

Consumables and non-renewing subscriptions can only be restored by using an account system with custom [App User IDs](/customers/user-ids). This is due to these types of in-app purchases not showing up on the underlying store receipt after the transaction is finished.

By logging in your users with a custom App User ID, RevenueCat can continue to provide transaction details in a user's [CustomerInfo](/customers/customer-info) for their previous consumable and non-renewing subscription purchases.

## Next Steps

- Make sure all purchases are being [linked to the correct App User ID](/customers/user-ids)
- If you're ready to test, start with our guides on [sandbox testing](/test-and-launch/debugging)
