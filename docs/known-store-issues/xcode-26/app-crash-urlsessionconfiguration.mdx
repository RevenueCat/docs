## Issue Description

Xcode 26 beta introduces a bug that may cause your app to crash when integrating multiple libraries‚Äîsuch as RevenueCat's SDK‚Äîthat utilize `URLSessionConfiguration`. This issue occurs when running the app on iOS 26 simulators.

You can find more information in the following [Apple Developer Forum thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/787365).

## Affected Versions

- Xcode 26 beta
- iOS 26 simulators

## Symptoms

- Your project includes libraries in addition to RevenueCat.
- The app crashes immediately upon launch when using Xcode 26 beta with iOS 26 simulators.

## Workarounds

While awaiting a fix from Apple, a temporary workaround is to initiate a networking call early during app initialization. This appears to prevent the crash.

import crash from "@site/code_blocks/known-issues/xcode-26-crash.swift?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "swift",
      title: "Networking call workaround",
      content: crash,
    },
  ]}
/>
