# iOS 18.4-18.5 Canceled State After Successful Purchase

## Resolved

Apple has rolled out a fix for this issue, and it should no longer be present in any version of iOS. We are keeping this page for historical reference.

## Issue Description

In iOS 18.4 through 18.5, StoreKit (and consequently the RevenueCat SDK) can incorrectly return a canceled state after a successful purchase. This occurs when the user receives a prompt to enable Receipt Renewal emails, which comes directly from StoreKit itself.

![iOS Renewal Email Prompt](/images/known-store-issues/ios-renewal-email-prompt.png)

## Affected Versions

- iOS 18.3.1 (possibly earlier, going back to 18.0)
- iOS 18.3.2
- iOS 18.4
- iOS 18.4.1
- iOS 18.5
- All platforms using StoreKit (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS)

## Symptoms

- Purchase appears to complete successfully
- User is charged for the purchase
- Receipt Renewal email prompt appears during or after purchase flow
- StoreKit incorrectly returns a "canceled" state despite successful payment
- RevenueCat SDK reports the purchase as canceled
- The purchase correctly goes through a few seconds later
- RevenueCat SDK reports the successful purchase through the CustomerInfo Delegate

## Frequency and Impact

- **Occurrence**: Only happens once per Apple ID account lifetime
- **Trigger**: First time a user encounters the Receipt Renewal email prompt
- **Status**: **Fixed by Apple** - The fix has been rolled out to all iOS versions

## Workaround

Since this issue has been resolved by Apple, the primary recommendation is to implement proper CustomerInfo monitoring to handle any edge cases that might still occur.

### Subscribe to CustomerInfo Updates

Monitor CustomerInfo changes to ensure you catch successful purchases even if the initial purchase callback reports an incorrect state:

    {
      type: "swift",
      content: content25,
    },
    {

      content: content27,
    },
    {
      type: "java",
      content: content28,
    },
    {

      content: content31,
    },
    {
      type: "rn",
      content: content30,
    },
    {
      type: "cordova",
      content: content29,
    },
    {
      type: "capacitor",
      content: contentCapacitor,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      content: content32,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Status

âœ… **Resolved** - Apple has fixed this issue and the fix has been deployed to all iOS versions. No further action is required for new app releases.

## Best Practices

Even though this specific issue has been resolved, implementing CustomerInfo listeners is still recommended as a best practice for:

- Handling family sharing changes
- Detecting subscription modifications from other devices
- Ensuring your app stays in sync with the latest entitlement status
