# Win-Back Offers

Apple introduced win-back offers with iOS 18, which allow developers to provide custom pricing and trials to subscribers who have canceled a subscription and meet specific eligibility criteria set by the developer.

## 1. Configuring a Win-Back Offer

:::warning
Win-Back Offers can only be configured for subscription products that have been approved by App Review. Please ensure that your subscription product has been approved by App Review before proceeding.
:::

Navigate to your subscription's page under *Apps* → *Your App* → *Subscriptions* (in the left sidebar) → *Your Subscription Group* → *Your Subscription Product* and click the "+" button by "Subscription Prices". If your subscription product has been approved by App Review, you'll see the option "Create Win-Back Offer". Select it.

![configure_winback_offer_1.png](/images/win-back-offers/configure_winback_offer_1.png)

To create the win-back offer there are two fields that you need to specify: Reference Name, which is just used for your reference, and the Offer Identifier, which is a distinct ID for the win-back offer.

![configure_winback_offer_2.png](/images/win-back-offers/configure_winback_offer_2.png)

Next, you’ll be asked to provide the specifics of your win-back offer, including:

- **Offer Publish Date**: The date interval that the win-back offer will be available to churned subscribers. ([More Info](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-store-pricing-and-availability-start-times-by-country-or-region))
- **Offer Priority**: Determines if this win-back offer takes precedence over other offers available for its product.
    - If a subscriber is eligible for multiple offers on the same subscription product, offers with a with a _high_ priority will be displayed instead of offers with a _normal_ priority in StoreKit views.
- **Customer Eligibility**: Developer-provided eligibility criteria that determines whether a churned subscriber can purchase a win-back offer.
  - *Minimum Paid Duration*: The time that a subscriber must have been subscribed to that product to be eligible for the offer.
  - *Time Since Last Subscribed*: A time interval describing how long a subscriber must have been lapsed to be eligible for the offer.
  - *Wait Between Offers*: The required time a subscriber must wait after a win-back offer ends before redeeming the same offer again. Optional.

## 2. Redeeming a Win-Back Offer
Subscribers can redeem a win-back offer in several ways. We're currently developing support for redeeming win-back offers within our SDK, and we will update this documentation as more redemption options become available.

### Redeeming a Win-Back Offer Through the App Store with Streamlined Purchasing Enabled
:::warning
Use this method only if you do not require subscribers to perform an action, like signing in before purchasing. If you do require such actions, disable Streamlined Purchasing (instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-subscriptions/manage-streamlined-purchasing)). By default, Streamlined Purchasing is enabled for all apps.
:::

Purchasing win-back offers through the App Store uses Streamlined Purchasing by default, meaning that subscribers can complete the entire win-back offer redemption flow in the App Store. In addition to the steps mentioned above to configure your win-back offer, we recommend doing the following:
1. Mandatory: Upload an image for your win-back offer in App Store Connect ([instructions](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-in-app-purchases/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information#add-or-remove-an-image)).
2. Enable [Apple App Store Notifications](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/platform-resources/server-notifications/apple-server-notifications) so that RevenueCat can be notified of win-back offers redeemed through the App Store, even if the user does not open your app.

#### Testing Win-Back Offers Redeemed Through the App Store with Streamlined Purchasing Enabled
Testing win-back offers redeemed through the App Store with Streamlined Purchasing enabled can only be performed in the sandbox environment on a physical device. To test win-back offers redeemed this way:
1. [Create a sandbox test account](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/test-and-launch/sandbox/apple-app-store#create-a-sandbox-test-account)
2. [Add the sandbox test account to your device](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/test-and-launch/sandbox/apple-app-store#add-the-sandbox-test-account-to-your-device)
3. Configure a win-back offer on a subscription product in App Store Connect as described above.
4. Make note of the product ID and the win-back offer ID. You'll need it later!
5. Cancel any subscriptions that are from the same subscription group as the win-back offer’s subscription.
6. Open your app and purchase the subscription product that contains the win-back offer.
7. Cancel the subscription. This can be done easily in the Settings app by navigating to your sandbox test account's page (*Settings* → *App Store* → *Sandbox Account* → *Manage* → *Subscriptions* → *Cancel Subscription*)
8. Close your app.
9. Wait for your subscription to expire.
10. In your sandbox test account's Account Settings page, turn off the "Display Win-back Offer Sheet" toggle

![disable_winback_offer_sheet.jpg](/images/win-back-offers/disable_winback_offer_sheet.jpg)

11. Select "Test Transactions"

![select_test_transactions.jpg](/images/win-back-offers/select_test_transactions.jpg)

12. Enter the product ID of the product you're testing, your app's bundle ID, and the win-back offer's identifier. These values _must_ be valid IDs entered into App Store Connect.

![test_transactions.jpg](/images/win-back-offers/test_transactions.jpg)


13. The system presents the App Store [Sandbox] payment sheet for the sandbox environment. Confirm the purchase.
14. Open your app.
15. Check that your app receives the proper entitlements from RevenueCat, and that the purchase appears in your RevenueCat dashboard with "Sandbox data" enabled.

Repeat steps 5-15 to test redeeming win-back offers multiple times.

## Considerations

- Since win-back offers use StoreKit 2 under the hood, you must upload an in-app purchase key to RevenueCat to use win-back offers. See our guide on [In-App Purchase Key Configuration](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration) for step-by-step instructions.
