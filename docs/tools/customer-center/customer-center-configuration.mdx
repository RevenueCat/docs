:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat's Customer Center is currently in beta, and only available on iOS 15.0+ at the moment. Feedback is welcome!
:::

## Overview

Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries â€” all without any help from your support team.

## Configuration

To configure the Customer Center, locate the Monetization Tools section of your Project Settings and click on **Customer Center**. The default configuration includes a set of paths, feedback surveys, and promotional offers that can be used immediately once your promotional offers are configured; or you can customize the configuration to your specific needs.

### What's configured by default

All four paths are configured by default:

- Cancellation
- Refund Request
- Plan changes
- Missing Purchases

The cancellation path is configured with a feedback survey with the following response options:

1. "Too expensive"
2. "Don't use the app"
3. "Bought by mistake"

By default, if your customer selects "Too expensive" or "Don't use the app", they'll receive the promotional offer `rc_cancel_offer`; while customers selecting "Bought by mistake" will receive the promotional offer `rc_refund_offer`. And of course, you can customize these responses and what (if anything) is offered to your liking.

If your customer selects Refund Request, they'll be given the `rc-refund-offer` by default.

:::warning Offers must be created in App Store Connect

:::

If your customer selects Missing Purchases, they'll be prompted to restore purchases.

### Support email

The support email is the email address that will be used to send emails to your customer in the following cases:

- If your customer chooses the "Missing Purchase" path, where they can contact you if they have trouble restoring their purchase.
- It is also used if the user is trying to manage a subscription that is not an Apple subscription, for example a Play Store subscription.

### Color customization

By default, the Customer Center will use your app's default color scheme throughout, ensuring a native look and feel.

However, you can also customize the colors of the Customer Center through the UI.

Here's how the color settings work:

- **Accent Color**: This color is used throughout the entire Customer Center for various UI elements like buttons. If not set, the app's default accent color will be used.

- **Background Color**: This color only applies to the promotional offers views. If not set, the app's default background color will be used.

- **Text Color**: This color only applies to the text in the promotional offers views. If not set, the app's default text color will be used.

- **Button Text Color**: This color only applies to the text in the promotional offers button. If not set, the app's default text color will be used.

- **Button Background Color**: This color only applies to the background of the promotional offers button. If not set, the app's default background color will be used.

:::tip
Remember, except for the accent color, these color settings only affect the promotional offers views. The rest of the Customer Center will use your app's default colors to maintain consistency with your app's overall design.

In addition, there are light and dark theme variants available, which you can set in the configuration UI.

## Advanced configuration

### Strings localization

The default configuration has been localized for 32 languages. If you want to customize the strings for a specific language, you can do so by editing them in the Localization tab.

#### Screens

The Customer Center is composed of different screens that customers can navigate through. The main screens are defined in the Configuration tab of the Customer Center settings.

This configuration defines two main screens:

1. **Management Screen**: This is the main screen customers see when they have an active subscription. It contains several paths (or actions) that customers can take:

   - Missing Purchase
   - Refund Request
   - Change Plans
   - Cancel Subscription

2. **No Active screen**: This screen is shown when the user doesn't have an active subscription. It typically only offers the option to restore purchases.

You can customize these screens by:

- Adding or removing paths
- Changing the order of the paths
- Modifying the title and subtitle keys to reference different localized strings

#### Paths

Paths define the different actions customers can take within the Customer Center. Each path has a unique configuration that determines its behavior.

Let's break down the configuration for each path:

1. **Missing Purchase**: Used for restoring previous purchases.

2. **Refund Request**: Allows customers to request refunds.

3. **Change Plans**: Enables customers to switch between different subscription plans.

4. **Cancel**: Provides an option for customers to cancel their subscription.

Key points about paths:

- Paths can include a promotional offer to present discounts to customers.
- Paths can include a feedback survey to gather information from customers.
- Feedback survey options can have their own promotional offer to provide targeted retention efforts.

You can customize these paths by:

- Adding or removing paths to change available actions.
- Modifying the title to change the displayed text (ensure the key exists in your localization configuration).
- Adding or adjusting promotional offer keys to change or introduce discount offers.
- Adding or adjusting feedback survey keys to change or introduce feedback surveys.

#### Feedback surveys

Any path can have a feedback survey attached to it with a question & answers that you configure. You might set one up to:

- Understand why customers are looking to cancel their subscription
- Uncover unmet expectations that led to a refund request, or
- Attempt to persuade customers to change their mind by delivering a promotional offer based on their specific feedback

### Promotional offers

:::warning Offers SDK requirement
Offers are only available starting with purchases-ios 5.9.0.
:::

Promotional offers can be attached to any feedback survey option or path to provide an extended trial, discounted price, or another offer of your choosing.

#### Adding promotional offers

:::warning Offers must be created in App Store Connect

:::

Promotional offers are defined in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings. Each offer can be referenced from paths or feedback survey options.

Key points about promotional offers:

- Each offer has a unique key which is internal and used to reference the offer from paths or feedback survey options (e.g., `cancel_promo_offer_key`, `refund_promo_offer_key`).
- The eligibility criteria defines conditions for when the offer can be presented.
- The title and subtitle reference localized strings for the offer's display text.
- The product mapping is a map of Apple Store product identifiers to promotional offer identifiers. The promotional offer has to be created in App Store Connect before it can be used. [Learn more.](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/customer-center/customer-center-integration#setting-up-promotional-offers) 

To use these offers, you link them from paths or feedback survey options in the configuration tab.

By configuring promotional offers this way, you can create targeted discount strategies for different user actions or feedback responses.

#### Eligibility conditions for promotional offers

You can customize a promotional offer's eligibility by setting conditions in the eligibility criteria. This allows you to control when and to whom the offer is presented. There are two types of conditions you can use:

1. **First Seen**: This condition is based on when the user was first seen by RevenueCat.
2. **Time Since First Purchase**: This condition is based on the time elapsed since the user's first purchase.

For both condition types, you can set the comparison to be either "More than" or "Less than", allowing you to target customers based on how long they've been using the app or how long they've been customers.

By using these eligibility conditions, you can create targeted offers for different segments of your user base, potentially increasing the effectiveness of your retention strategies.
