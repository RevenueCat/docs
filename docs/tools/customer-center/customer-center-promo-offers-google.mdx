Promotional Offers allow developers to apply custom pricing and trials to new customers and to existing and lapsed subscriptions. Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be setup in Play Store.

The Customer Center will automatically show offers based on specific user actions. By default we have defined it for cancellations but it can be modified to any of the defined paths. Here’s how it works:

- **Cancellation Retention Discount**: By default, for responses in the cancellation survey, RevenueCat will use a promotional offer that you can customize in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

This setup enables RevenueCat to automatically match the right offer based on a user’s actions, providing a seamless experience when user tries to cancel their active subscription.

The SDK will automatically match the right offer based on a user’s actions and its active subscription. If the SDK cannot locate a matching promotional offer id for the currently active user's subscription, it will bypass the survey and proceed with the user’s requested action—either canceling or refunding the subscription.

**These promotional offers must be created in App Store Connect and Google Play Store in order to be shown to customers**

## Setting up promotional offers

Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be setup in App Store Connect and Google Play Console.

Offers on the Play Store allow you to provide a custom price or a trial (or both) for a product. There are [different types of offers](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/google-play-offers#eligibility-criteria) that can be created in the Play Store. For the Customer Center, you will be using the **Developer determined** type.

Additionally, **add the `rc-customer-center` tag** to the developer determined offer from your product so that the offer is only available to Customer Center **and not used as a default offer when purchasing the product**. 

:::warning Offers must be created in Google Play Console and tagged
Don't forget to add the tag `rc-customer-center` to the offer so that the offer is only available to Customer Center and not used as a default offer when purchasing the product or in Paywalls.

## Displaying the promotional offer

After creating a promotional offer for a product in Google Play Console, it needs to be assigned to a particular offer in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

For example, if you just created an offer with id `monthly_subscription_cancel_offer` in Google Play Console for your monthly subscription product, edit the `Cancellation Retention Discount` offer in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings, and assign the id of the promotional offer id to that monthly subscription product.

You may also customize your configuration to provide other offers, or provide them when the user performs other actions. [Learn more about configuring the Customer Center.](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration)

You can customize a promotional offer's eligibility by setting conditions in the eligibility criteria. This allows you to control when and to whom the offer is presented. By using these eligibility conditions, you can create targeted offers for different segments of your user base, potentially increasing the effectiveness of your retention strategies.
