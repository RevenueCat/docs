## Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-android.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases)

Before integrating the Customer Center in Android, you need to add the `com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui` SDK <code>{sdkVersions.android}</code> or higher to your app.

```groovy build.gradle
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:<latest version>'
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui:<latest version>'
```

## Integration
There's a `CustomerCenter` composable that can be used to display the Customer Center. It's intended to be used as a full screen composable so make sure to use it with a `fillMaxSize` modifier:

import usageViewKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-1.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: usageViewKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

Alternatively, you can instantiate the Customer Center as an Activity:

import usageActivityKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-2.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: usageActivityKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

### Ensuring Proper Theming for Customer Center

To ensure that Customer Center displays correctly with the right colors, contrast, and theme consistency, it needs to be wrapped inside MaterialTheme.
This allows it to dynamically adapt to dark and light mode while applying the correct Material Design colors to all UI elements.
If your app already wraps its composables in MaterialTheme, no additional changes are needed.
However, if CustomerCenter is the only composable in your hierarchy, you may need to explicitly wrap it in MaterialTheme to ensure proper theming.

import usageThemeKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-3.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: usageThemeKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

## Listening to Customer Center Events

You can listen to Customer Center events in two ways: using a global listener, or using a local listener through the CustomerCenter composable options.

First, create a CustomerCenterListener implementation:

import eventsBaseKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-android-base.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: eventsBaseKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

Then, you can use it in one of two ways:

1. As a global listener that will be called for all Customer Center instances:

import eventsGlobalKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-android-global.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: eventsGlobalKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

2. As a local listener through the CustomerCenter composable options:

import eventsLocalKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-android-local.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: eventsLocalKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

The following events are available:

- `onManagementOptionSelected`: Called when a user selects a management option (missing purchase, cancel, or custom URL)
- `onRestoreStarted`: Called when the restore process begins
- `onRestoreCompleted`: Called when the restore process completes successfully
- `onRestoreFailed`: Called when the restore process fails
- `onShowingManageSubscriptions`: Called when the manage subscriptions screen is shown
- `onFeedbackSurveyCompleted`: Called when a user completes a feedback survey

## Setup promotional offers

Promotional Offers allow developers to apply custom pricing and trials to new customers and to existing and lapsed subscriptions. Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be setup in Google Play Console.

The Customer Center will automatically show offers based on specific user actions. By default we have defined it for cancellations but it can be modified to any of the defined paths. Refer to [configuring Google Play Store promotional offers](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-promo-offers-google) for detailed instructions.

Learn more about configuring the Customer Center in the [configuration guide](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration).
