## Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-ios.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/releases)

Before integrating the Customer Center in iOS, you need to add the RevenueCatUI SDK <code>{sdkVersions.ios}</code> or higher to your app.

### Using SPM

#### If you already have `RevenueCat` in your project:

1. Open your project settings and select "Package Dependencies":

![Change version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/d317fd33-8270-4d9b-9b38-8f5f14342b04)

2. Double-click and make sure version is at least <code>{sdkVersions.ios}</code>:

![Configure version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/f537a1e1-a1ab-4e6f-986c-05abdcf1dd9f)

3. Open your target settings and find "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content":

![Find frameworks in your target](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/af078e9a-4b98-42c6-8ca7-6f79aebdf3e0)

4. Add `RevenueCatUI`:

![Add RevenueCatUI dependency](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/c2a3498c-b80d-405c-bdf6-75de927ea58e)

#### First time integrating the RevenueCat SDK:

1. Click File -> Add Packages...

2. Search for `git@github.com:RevenueCat/purchases-ios.git` and make sure version is at least <code>{sdkVersions.ios}</code>:

![Adding purchases-ios dependency](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/18291043-5710-4944-ba12-7d6d83bde240)

3. Add `RevenueCat` and `RevenueCatUI` SPM dependency to your project:

![Add paywall](/docs_images/customer-center/9140485-Screenshot_2023-08-04_at_12.08.07_78343500e565bc1fd0fceaac72486876.png)

### Using CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'RevenueCat'
pod 'RevenueCatUI'
```

## Integration

The CustomerCenterView can be integrated in a few different ways depending on how you want to present it within your app.

The simplest way to present the CustomerCenterView is using a modal sheet:

import usageViewSheet from '@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-1-sheet.swift?raw';

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageViewSheet, name: "SwiftUI" }]} />

If you prefer a more declarative and reusable approach, you can use the provided view modifier:

import usageModifier from '@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-2.swift?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageModifier, name: "SwiftUI" }]}
/>

For apps already using NavigationStack or NavigationView, CustomerCenterView can be pushed onto your stack:

import usageViewStack from '@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-1-navigationstack.swift?raw';

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageViewStack, name: "SwiftUI" }]} />

### Listening to events

We've added a way to listen to events that occur within the `CustomerCenterView`:

import customerCenterEvents from '@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events.swift?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: customerCenterEvents, name: "Swift" }]}
/>

If using the modifier:

import customerCenterEventsModifier from '@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-modifier.swift?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: customerCenterEventsModifier, name: "Swift" },
  ]}
/>

### Custom Actions

:::info Custom Actions support
Custom Actions require iOS SDK version 5.34.0 or later, and Android SDK version 9.2.0 or later.
:::

Custom Actions allow you to add your own custom management options to the Customer Center. When a customer taps on a custom action, your app receives a callback with the custom action identifier, allowing you to execute your own code.

To handle custom actions, use the `.onCustomerCenterCustomActionSelected` modifier:

```swift
CustomerCenterView()
.onCustomerCenterCustomActionSelected { actionIdentifier, purchaseIdentifier in
    // Handle your custom action
    // Execute your custom logic here
}
```

Custom actions are configured in the RevenueCat dashboard under Customer Center settings, where you can:
- Set a custom identifier for the action
- Configure the display text and localization
- Position the action within the management options

## Setup promotional offers

Promotional Offers allow developers to apply custom pricing and trials to new customers and to existing and lapsed subscriptions. Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be set up in App Store Connect.

The Customer Center will automatically show offers based on specific user actions. By default we have defined it for cancellations but it can be modified to any of the defined paths. Refer to [configuring App Store Connect promotional offers](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-promo-offers-apple) for detailed instructions.

Learn more about configuring the Customer Center in the [configuration guide](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration).
