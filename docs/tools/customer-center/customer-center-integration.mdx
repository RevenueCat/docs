## Overview

Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries — all without any help from your support team.

There are only two steps to integrate Customer Center in your app:

1. Implementing the Customer Center view in your app
2. Setting up promotional offers

## Implementation

### iOS

You can use the `CustomerCenterView` directly:

import usageView from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-1.swift";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageView, name: "SwiftUI" }]} />

Or via a modifier:

import usageModifier from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-2.swift";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageModifier, name: "SwiftUI" }]}
/>

#### Listening to events

We've added a way to listen to events that occur within the `CustomerCenterView`. For now, we are not posting any event to our backend (like feedback survey selections). We are going to be adding way more events in the future, but these are what are available for now:

import customerCenterEvents from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events.swift";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: customerCenterEvents, name: "Swift" }]}
/>

If using the modifier:

import customerCenterEventsModifier from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-modifier.swift";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: customerCenterEventsModifier, name: "Swift" },
  ]}
/>

### Android

There's a `CustomerCenter` composable that can be used to display the Customer Center. It's intended to be used as a full screen composable so make sure to use it with a `fillMaxSize` modifier:

import usageViewKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-1.kt";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "kotlin", content: usageViewKotlin, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

## Setting up promotional offers

Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be setup in App Store Connect and Google Play Console.

### App Store

Promotional offers on the App Store allow you to provide a custom price or trial for a product to existing or previously subscribed customers. These offers are used in the Customer Center to 
incentivize customers to stay subscribed who otherwise intend to cancel their subscription or request a refund.

### Play Store

Offers on the Play Store allow you to provide a custom price or a trial (or both) for a product. There are [different types of offers](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/google-play-offers#eligibility-criteria) that can be created in the Play Store. For the Customer Center, you will be using the **Developer determined** type.

Additionally, **add the `rc-customer-center` tag** to the developer determined offer from your product so that the offer is only available to Customer Center **and not used as a default offer when purchasing the product**. 

:::warning Offers must be created in Google Play Console and tagged
Don't forget to add the tag `rc-customer-center` to the offer so that the offer is only available to Customer Center and not used as a default offer when purchasing the product or in Paywalls.

### Required promotional offers

:::warning Offers must be created in App Store Connect and Google Play Console
You need to add the store specific promotional offer ids you want to use for each of your products in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings. Otherwise, the promotional offer will not be shown to customers.
:::

The Customer Center will automatically show offers based on specific user actions. By default we have defined it for refunds (iOS only) and cancellations but it can be modified to any of the defined paths. Here’s how it works:

![Promotional Offers Configuration](/images/customer-center-promo-offers-config.png)

- **Cancellation Retention Discount**: By default, for responses in the cancellation survey, RevenueCat will use a promotional offer that you can customize in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

- **Refund Retention Discount (iOS only)**: By default, when a user requests a refund in iOS, RevenueCat will use a promotional offer that you can customize in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

This setup enables RevenueCat to automatically match the right offer based on a user’s actions, providing a seamless experience for both cancellation and refund requests.

The SDK will automatically match the right offer based on a user’s actions and its active subscription. If the SDK cannot locate a matching promotional offer id for the currently active user's subscription, it will bypass the survey and proceed with the user’s requested action—either canceling or refunding the subscription.

:::warning Upgrade offers are not supported
It is currently not possible to offer an upgrade offer for a different product than the one the user is currently subscribed to.
:::

**These promotional offers must be created in App Store Connect and Google Play Console in order to be shown to customers.** After creating a promotional offer for a product in App Store Connect or Google Play Console, you have to assign it to a particular offer in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

For example, if you just created an offer with id "monthly_subscription_refund_offer" in App Store Connect for your monthly subscription product, you would go to the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings and edit the "Refund Retention Discount" offer, and assign the id of the promotional offer id to that monthly subscription product.

You may also customize your configuration to provide other offers, or provide them when the user performs other actions. [Learn more about configuring the Customer Center.](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration)
