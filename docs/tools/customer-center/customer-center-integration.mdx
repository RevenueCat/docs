:::warning Beta Feature
RevenueCat's Customer Center is currently in beta, and only available on iOS 15.0+ at the moment. Feedback is welcome!
:::

## Overview

Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries — all without any help from your support team.

There are only two steps to integrate the Customer Center in your app:

1. Implementing the Customer Center view in your app
2. Setting up promotional offers

## Implementation

You can use the `CustomerCenterView` view directly:

import usageView from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-1.swift";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageView, name: "SwiftUI" }]} />

Or via a modifier:

import usageModifier from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-usage-2.swift";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: usageModifier, name: "SwiftUI" }]}
/>

### Listening to events

We've added a way to listen to events that occur within the `CustomerCenterView`. For now, we are not posting any event to our backend (like feedback survey selections). We are going to be adding way more events in the future, but these are what are available for now:

import customerCenterEvents from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events.swift";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: customerCenterEvents, name: "Swift" }]}
/>

If using the modifier:

import customerCenterEventsModifier from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-modifier.swift";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: customerCenterEventsModifier, name: "Swift" },
  ]}
/>

## Setting up promotional offers

:::warning Offers SDK requirement
Configuring promotional offers per product id is only available starting with purchases-ios 5.9.0.
:::

Promotional offers on the App Store allow you to provide a custom price or trial for a product to existing or previosuly subscribed customers. These offers are used in the Customer Center to incentivize customers to stay subscribed who otherwise intend to cancel their subscription or request a refund.

Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be setup in App Store Connect.

### Required promotional offers

:::warning Offers must be created in App Store Connect
You need to add the App Store promotional offer ids you want to use for each of your products in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings. Otherwise, the promotional offer will not be shown to customers.
:::

The Customer Center will automatically show promotional offers based on specific user actions. By default we have defined it for refunds and cancellations but it can be modified to any of the defined paths. Here’s how it works:

Cancellation Offers: By default, for responses in the cancellation survey, RevenueCat will use a promotional offer that you can customize in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

Refund Offers: By default, when a user requests a refund, RevenueCat will use a promotional offer that you can customize in the Offers tab of the Customer Center settings.

This setup enables RevenueCat to automatically match the right offer based on a user’s actions, providing a seamless experience for both cancellation and refund requests.

If the SDK cannot locate a matching promotional offer id, it will bypass the survey and proceed with the user’s requested action—either canceling or refunding the subscription.

**These promotional offers must be created in App Store Connect in order to be shown to customers.** You may also customize your configuration to provide other offers, or provide them at other points.
