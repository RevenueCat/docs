import { sdkVersions } from '@site/src/components/CustomerCenter/CustomerCenterSDKTable';

## Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/releases)

Before integrating the Customer Center in React Native, update your `package.json` to include `react-native-purchases-ui` <code>{sdkVersions.reactNative}</code> or higher to your app.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-purchases": "<latest version>",
    "react-native-purchases-ui": "<latest version>"
  }
}
```

## Integration

Opening the customer center is as simple as:

```tsx
await RevenueCatUI.presentCustomerCenter();
```

#### Listening to events

We've added a way to listen to events that occur within the Customer Center. For now, we are not posting any event to our backend (like feedback survey selections). We are going to be adding way more events in the future, but these are what are available for now:

import customerCenterEventsReactNative from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/customer-center-events-react-native.tsx";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[{ type: "tsx", content: customerCenterEventsReactNative, name: "React Native" }]}
/>

## Setup promotional offers

Promotional Offers allow developers to apply custom pricing and trials to new customers and to existing and lapsed subscriptions. Unique promotional offers can be assigned to different paths and survey responses in the Customer Center, but first they must be setup in App Store Connect and Google Play Store.

The Customer Center will automatically show offers based on specific user actions. By default we have defined it for cancellations but it can be modified to any of the defined paths. For React Native you are going to have to configure these promotional offers in both Google Play Console and App Store Connect.
Refer to [configuring Google Play Store promotional offers](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-promo-offers-google) and [configuring App Store Connect promotional offers](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-promo-offers-apple) for detailed instructions.

Learn more about configuring the Customer Center in the [configuration guide](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration).
