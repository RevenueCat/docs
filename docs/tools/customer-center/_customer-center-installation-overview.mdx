## Overview

Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries â€” all without any help from your support team.

There are only three steps to integrate Customer Center in your app:

1. Installing the RevenueCat UI SDK in your app
1. Implementing the Customer Center view in your app
1. Setting up promotional offers in App Store Connect/Google Play Console
