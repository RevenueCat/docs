RevenueCat's Funnels allow you to build customizable, hosted web onboarding experiences that can be designed remotely and shipped by non-developers. Funnels enable you to create multi-step web flows that collect customer information, guide users through your value proposition, and seamlessly transition to purchase.

## What are Funnels?

Funnels are multi-step web experiences hosted by RevenueCat that combine the flexibility of Paywalls with configurable flows to design your own custom web acquisition funnel. Each funnel consists of multiple **steps** that can be connected to create linear or branching user journeys.

With Funnels, you can:

- **Design custom onboarding flows** that match your brand and aesthetics
- **Collect customer information** through survey questions
- **Create branching logic** where user responses, URL parameters, and other dimensions determine the next step in the flow
- **Connect attribution data** via UTM parameters for branching logic & filtering analytics
- **Remotely configure** your entire funnel experience without code changes
- **Ship updates instantly** without any technical expertise

## Why use Funnels?

Funnels provide several key advantages for apps investing in user acquisition:

- **Improved attribution**: Automatically capture and surface UTM parameters and other tracking data from ad campaigns, making it easy to measure the effectiveness of your marketing spend and understand which campaigns drive the highest LTV customers.
- **Lower friction**: Web-based onboarding experiences eliminate the need for users to install an app before making a purchase decision. This reduces friction in the conversion process and can improve conversion rates compared to app-only flows.
- **Rapid iteration**: Since funnels are remotely configured, you can test different messaging, layouts, and flow logic without requiring app updates or developer involvement. This enables faster experimentation and optimization of your conversion funnel.
- **Unified experience**: Funnels integrate seamlessly with RevenueCat's existing infrastructure, including Offerings, Paywalls, and Web Purchase Links. This means you can create a cohesive experience that connects web onboarding to in-app entitlements.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| **Funnel** | A multi-step web experience consisting of connected screens and checkout pages |
| **Step** | An individual page in your funnel. Steps can be screens (fully customizable pages) or checkout (hosted purchase flow) |
| **Screen** | A customizable page built using RevenueCat's Paywall UI builder. Screens can contain text, images, buttons, input fields, and other components, just like a Paywall |
| **Checkout** | A dedicated purchase step that handles the payment flow using RevenueCat Web Billing |
| **Trigger** | An action on a step (like button press or form submission) that determines the next step in the flow |
| ** Branch** | Conditional logic that determines the next step in the flow based on conditions you configure on a trigger |
| **Initial step** | The first step that users see when they access your funnel |
| **Template** | Pre-built funnel configurations that you can use as starting points |
