:::info Paywalls v2 Beta
We've recently released our new paywall editor in public beta. If you're looking to check out Paywalls v2 while in beta, [click here](/tools/paywalls-v2).
:::

You can think of a Paywall as an optional feature of your Offering. An Offering is the collection of Products which are organized into Packages to be displayed to your customers as a single "offer" across platforms. Now, with Paywalls, you can control the actual view that is used to display that "offer" in addition to controlling the products that are offered.

Therefore, you can create a unique Paywall for each of your Offerings, and can create an unlimited number of Offerings & Paywalls for each variation you want to test with Experiments.

### Getting Started

Our paywall templates use native code to deliver smooth, intuitive experiences to your customers when you’re ready to deliver them an Offering; and you can use our Dashboard to pick the right template and configuration to meet your needs.

To use RevenueCat Paywalls, simply:

1. [Install the RevenueCat UI SDK](/tools/paywalls/installation)

2. [Create a Paywall](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls) on the Dashboard for the [Offering](/getting-started/entitlements) you intend to serve to your customers

3. See [displaying paywalls](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls) for how to display it into your app.

### Android's Google Play developer determined offers

Paywalls in Android will use the default subscription option which, in case you use [developer determined offers](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/google-play-offers#eligibility-criteria), will always be available, providing these types of offers always to your users. If you want to avoid this behavior when using paywalls, add the `rc-ignore-offer` tag to the developer determined offer from your product.
