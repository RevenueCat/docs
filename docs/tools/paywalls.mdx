## How Paywalls work

### iOS Installation

#### Using SPM:

##### If you already have `RevenueCat` in your project:

1. Open your project settings and select "Package Dependencies":

![Change version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/d317fd33-8270-4d9b-9b38-8f5f14342b04)

2. Double-click and make sure version is at least `4.26.0`:

![Configure version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/f537a1e1-a1ab-4e6f-986c-05abdcf1dd9f)

3. Open your target settings and find "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content":

![Find frameworks in your target](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/af078e9a-4b98-42c6-8ca7-6f79aebdf3e0)

4. Add `RevenueCatUI`:

![Add RevenueCatUI dependency](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/c2a3498c-b80d-405c-bdf6-75de927ea58e)

##### First time integrating the RevenueCat SDK:

1. Click File -> Add Packages...

2. Search for `git@github.com:RevenueCat/purchases-ios.git` and make sure version is at least `4.26.0`:

![Adding purchases-ios dependency](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/18291043-5710-4944-ba12-7d6d83bde240)

3. Add `RevenueCat` and `RevenueCatUI` SPM dependency to your project:

![Add paywall](/images/9140485-Screenshot_2023-08-04_at_12.08.07_78343500e565bc1fd0fceaac72486876.png)

#### Using CocoaPods:

Add the following to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'RevenueCat'
pod 'RevenueCatUI'
```

### Android Installation

1. Add `RevenueCatUI`:
```groovy build.gradle
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:7.1.0'
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui:7.1.0'
```

:::danger
Android paywalls is currently behind an experimental flag (`ExperimentalPreviewRevenueCatUIPurchasesAPI`).

It is safe to release app updates with it. We guarantee that paywalls will continue to work and any changes will always be backwards compatible.

They are stable, but migration steps may be required in the future. We'll do our best to minimize any changes you have to make.
:::

### React Native Installation

- Update your `package.json` to include `react-native-purchases-ui`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-purchases": "7.15.0",
    "react-native-purchases-ui": "7.15.0"
  }
}
```

### Flutter Installation

- Add `purchases-ui-flutter` in your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  purchases_flutter: 6.15.0
  purchases_ui_flutter: 6.15.0
```
- For Android, you need to change your `MainActivity` to subclass `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`.

### Kotlin Multiplatform Installation

Add the following Maven coordinates to your `libs.versions.toml`:
```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions] 
purchases-kmp = "1.0.0+13.2.0"

[libraries]
purchases-core = { module = "com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-core", version.ref = "purchases-kmp" }
purchases-ui = { module = "com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-ui", version.ref = "purchases-kmp" }
```

Then add the dependencies to the `commonMain` sourceset in your Compose Multiplatform module's `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    // ...
    sourceSets {
        // ...
        commonMain.dependencies {  
            // Add the purchases-kmp dependencies.
            implementation(libs.purchases.core)  
            implementation(libs.purchases.ui)  
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, you'll need to make sure you link the `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` native iOS framework. If your iOS app uses Swift Package Manager, add the `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` library to your target in the same way you added the `PurchasesHybridCommon` library. If your iOS app uses CocoaPods, either update its `Podfile`, or update your Compose Multiplatform module's `build.gradle.kts`, depending on how your Multiplatform module is integrated with your iOS project.


### Overview

Our paywall templates use native code to deliver smooth, intuitive experiences to your customers when you’re ready to deliver them an Offering; and you can use our Dashboard to pick the right template and configuration to meet your needs.

To use RevenueCat Paywalls, simply:

1. [Create a Paywall](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls) on the Dashboard for the [Offering](/getting-started/entitlements) you intend to serve to your customers

2. See [displaying paywalls](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls) for how to display it into your app.

### Offerings and Paywalls

You can think of a Paywall as an optional feature of your Offering. An Offering is the collection of Products which are organized into Packages to be displayed to your customers as a single "offer" across platforms. Now, with Paywalls, you can control the actual view that is used to display that "offer" in addition to controlling the products that are offered.

Therefore, you can create a unique Paywall for each of your Offerings, and can create an unlimited number of Offerings & Paywalls for each variation you want to test with Experiments.

## Limitations

### Platforms (support for more coming)
* ✅  iOS 15.0 and higher
* ✅  visionOS 1.0 and higher
* ✅  Mac Catalyst 15.0 and higher
* ✅  watchOS 8.0 and higher
* ✅  Android 7.0 (API level 24)
* ❌  macOS
* ❌  tvOS

### Android's Google Play developer determined offers
Paywalls in Android will use the default subscription option which, in case you use [developer determined offers](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/google-play-offers#eligibility-criteria), will always be available, providing these types of offers always to your users. If you want to avoid this behavior when using paywalls, add the `rc-ignore-offer` tag to the developer determined offer from your product.

## Next Steps

* Now that you know how our paywalls work, read about [creating paywalls](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls)
* Once you're ready to see your paywalls in action, you can follow our guides on [displaying paywalls](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls)
* If you need inspiration with some paywall examples, you can try our [Paywalls Tester app](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/tree/main/Tests/TestingApps/PaywallsTester)
