### How to display a Paywall in your app

RevenueCat Paywalls v2 will show paywalls fullscreen, and there are multiple ways to do this with SwiftUI and UIKit.

- Depending on an entitlement with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Custom logic with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Manually with `PaywallView` or `PaywallViewController`

import swift1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.swift";
import swift2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.swift";
import swift3 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3.swift";
import swift4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.swift";
import objc5 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_5.m";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: swift1,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: swift2,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually",
        content: swift3,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually (UIKit)",
        content: swift4,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        title: "Manually (UIKit and Objective-C)",
        content: objc5,
    },

]}/>

### Handling paywall navigation

[Outline:

1. When creating a paywall, consider whether it will be presented in a sheet, or as a view.
2. Sheets won't require a dedicated close button, whereas views should have them unless you're building a hard paywall (explicit instructions on how we recommend setting up a hard paywall?)
3. .onRequestedDismissal() caveat if applicable?]

:::info Footer Mode from original Paywalls
Paywalls v2 does not support Footer Mode. If your app requests the Paywall for an Offering to display that has a v2 Paywall, it will display a default version of that paywall instead (see below). Footer Mode can still be used on original paywall templates using the existing method, or the new `originalTemplatePaywallFooter()` method on iOS SDK versions 5.16.0+.
:::

## Default Paywall

If you attempt to display a Paywall for an Offering that doesn't have one configured, or that has a Paywall configured which is not supported on the installed SDK version, the RevenueCatUI SDK will display a default Paywall.

The default paywall displays all packages in the Offering.

On iOS it uses the app's `accentColor` for styling.
On Android, it uses the app's `Material3`'s `ColorScheme`.

:::tip Targeting
If your app supports our original Paywall templates, consider using Targeting to create an audience that only receives your v2 Paywall if they're using RC iOS SDK version 5.16.0+. This will ensure that older app versions continue to receive the Offering and Paywall that they support, while any app versions running a supported RC iOS SDK version receive your new v2 Paywall.
