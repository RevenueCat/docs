## iOS

### How to display a Paywall in your app

RevenueCat Paywalls v2 will show paywalls fullscreen, and there are multiple ways to do this with SwiftUI and UIKit.

- Depending on an entitlement with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Custom logic with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Manually with `PaywallView` or `PaywallViewController`

import swift1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.swift";
import swift2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.swift";
import swift3 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3.swift";
import swift4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.swift";
import objc5 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_5.m";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: swift1,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: swift2,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually",
        content: swift3,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually (UIKit)",
        content: swift4,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        title: "Manually (UIKit and Objective-C)",
        content: objc5,
    },

]}/>

### Handling paywall navigation

When creating a paywall, consider whether it will be presented in a sheet, or as a view. Sheets won't require a dedicated close button, whereas views should have them unless you intend to provide a hard paywall to your customers that cannot be bypassed.

### Additional changes from original Paywalls

#### Footer Paywalls

Paywalls v2 does not support footer Paywalls. If your app requests the Paywall for an Offering to display that has a v2 Paywall, it will display a default version of that paywall instead (see below). Footer mode can still be used on original Paywalls templates using the existing method, or the new `.originalTemplatePaywallFooter()` method on iOS SDK versions 5.16.0+.

#### Close buttons

Paywalls v2 does not require the `displayCloseButton` parameter, and it will have no effect if used, since close buttons can be optionally added directly to your paywall as a component if desired.

#### Font provider

Paywalls v2 does not support passing in a custom font provider via the `PaywallFontProvider` handler that original Paywalls used. Instead, in the near future you'll be able to configure Paywalls to use the font providers you've already installed in your app directly from the Dashboard. Using this handler will have no effect on Paywalls v2.

## Default Paywall

If you attempt to display a Paywall for an Offering that doesn't have one configured, or that has a Paywall configured which is not supported on the installed SDK version, the RevenueCatUI SDK will display a default Paywall.

The default paywall displays all packages in the Offering.

On iOS it uses the app's `accentColor` for styling.
On Android, it uses the app's `Material3`'s `ColorScheme`.

:::tip Targeting
If your app supports our original Paywall templates, consider using Targeting to create an audience that only receives your v2 Paywall if they're using RC iOS SDK version 5.16.0+. This will ensure that older app versions continue to receive the Offering and Paywall that they support, while any app versions running a supported RC iOS SDK version receive your new v2 Paywall.
