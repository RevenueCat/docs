## Platform specific instructions

### iOS

RevenueCat Paywalls v2 will show paywalls fullscreen, and there are multiple ways to do this with SwiftUI and UIKit.

- Depending on an entitlement with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Custom logic with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Manually with `PaywallView` or `PaywallViewController`

import swift1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.swift";
import swift2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.swift";
import swift3 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3.swift";
import swift4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.swift";
import objc5 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_5.m";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: swift1,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: swift2,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually",
        content: swift3,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually (UIKit)",
        content: swift4,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        title: "Manually (UIKit and Objective-C)",
        content: objc5,
    },

]}/>

### Android

RevenueCat Paywalls will, by default, show paywalls fullscreen and there are multiple ways to do this with `Activity`s and Jetpack Compose.

- Depending on an entitlement with `PaywallDialog`
- Custom logic with `PaywallDialog`
- Manually with `Paywall`, `PaywallDialog`, or `PaywallActivityLauncher`

import kotlin1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.kt";
import kotlin2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.kt";
import kotlin3 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3.kt";
import kotlin4 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.kt";
import paywallsActivityJava from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_activity_java.java";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: kotlin1,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: kotlin2,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Manually",
        content: kotlin3,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Manually (Activity)",
        content: kotlin4,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        title: "Manually (Activity) - Java",
        content: paywallsActivityJava,
    }

]}/>

### React Native

There are several ways to present paywalls:

- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall`: this will display a paywall when invoked.
- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded`: this will present a paywall only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- Manually presenting `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>`: this gives you more flexibility on how the paywall is presented.

import rn1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_1.ts";
import rn2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_2.ts";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "rn",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall",
      content: rn1,
    },
    {
      type: "rn",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.Paywall",
      content: rn2,
    },
  ]}
/>

There are also several listeners that can be used to handle the paywall lifecycle, such as `onPurchaseStarted`, `onPurchaseCompleted`, and `onRestoreStarted`.

#### Listeners

When using `RevenueCatUI.Paywall`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions.

Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onPurchaseCancelled
- onRestoreStarted
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError
- onDismiss

### Flutter

There are several ways to present paywalls:

- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall`: this will display a paywall when invoked.
- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded`: this will present a paywall only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- Manually presenting `PaywallView`: this gives you more flexibility on how the paywall is presented.

import flutter1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_1.dart";
import flutter2 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_2.dart";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "flutter",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall",
      content: flutter1,
    },
    {
      type: "flutter",
      title: "PaywallView",
      content: flutter2,
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Listeners

When using `PaywallView`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions.
Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError
- onDismiss

### Kotlin Multiplatform

You can present a fullscreen Paywall using the `Paywall` composable. You have the flexibility to decide when to call this. You could, for instance, add it to your navigation graph.

import kmp1 from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_kmp_1.kts";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "kotlin",
      title: "Paywall",
      content: kmp1,
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Listeners

When using `Paywall`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions.
Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onPurchaseCancelled
- onRestoreStarted
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError

## Handling paywall navigation

When creating a paywall, consider whether it will be presented in a sheet, or as a full screen view. Sheets won't require a dedicated close button. Full screen views should have either a close button (if presented modally) or a back button (if part of a navigation stack or host) unless you intend to provide a hard paywall to your customers that cannot be bypassed.

## Custom fonts

Paywalls v2 supports custom fonts, but it works slightly differently than original Paywalls. The `FontProvider` in the SDKs is ignored for v2 Paywalls. Instead, every text component in the paywall editor has a "Font family" property with a gear icon next to it. Clicking the gear icon allows you to configure your font families. In the modal that opens, you can name your font family, and set up the corresponding font for both Android and iOS. Fonts you can use include:

- System fonts
- Any of `sans-serif`, `serif`, or `monospace`
- Custom fonts already included in your app

### Including custom fonts in your app

#### Android
To add a custom font to your Android app, place the font file in the `res/font` folder. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/text-and-emoji/fonts-in-xml) for more information.

#### iOS
To add a custom font to your iOS app, go to _File_ and then _Add Files to “Your Project Name”_. The font file should be a target member of your app, and be registered with iOS by adding the "Fonts provided by the application" key to your _Info.plist_ file. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/adding-a-custom-font-to-your-app) for more information.

#### Kotlin Multiplatform, React Native, and Flutter
Adding custom fonts to a hybrid app involves adding the font files to the underlying Android and iOS projects following the instructions above.

## Changes from original Paywalls

#### Footer Paywalls

Paywalls v2 does not support footer Paywalls. If your app requests the Paywall for an Offering to display that has a v2 Paywall, it will display a default version of that paywall instead (see below). Footer mode can still be used on original Paywalls templates using the existing method, or the new `.originalTemplatePaywallFooter()` method on iOS SDK versions 5.16.0+.

#### Close buttons

Paywalls v2 does not require the `displayCloseButton` parameter (or equivalent for other platforms), and it will have no effect if used, since close buttons can be optionally added directly to your paywall as a component if desired.

#### Font provider

Paywalls v2 does not support passing in a custom font provider as original Paywalls did. Instead, you can now configure Paywalls to use the fonts you've already installed in your app directly from the Dashboard. Using the original handler will have no effect on Paywalls v2. See the [Custom fonts](#custom-fonts) section for more information. 

## Default Paywall

If you attempt to display a Paywall for an Offering that doesn't have one configured, or that has a Paywall configured which is not supported on the installed SDK version, the RevenueCatUI SDK will display a default Paywall.

The default paywall displays all packages in the Offering.

On iOS it uses the app's `accentColor` for styling.
On Android, it uses the app's `Material3`'s `ColorScheme`.

:::tip Targeting
If your app supports our original Paywall templates, consider using Targeting to create an audience that only receives your v2 Paywall if they're using an SDK version that does not support Paywalls v2. This will ensure that older app versions continue to receive the Offering and Paywall that they support, while any app versions running a supported RC SDK version receive your new v2 Paywall.
