:::info Introduction
Read more about the new Web Purchase Button in our [blog post](https://revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons) announcement.
:::

RevenueCat Paywalls v2 supports the Web Purchase Button as a button destination as an alternative to the default purchase button. The Web Purchase Button opens an external link from your app to a [Web Billing](/web/web-billing/overview) paywall.

To add a Web Purchase Button to your paywall, you can use the Button component and select 'Navigate to' -> 'Web Purchase'.

:::warning
Offering a web checkout experience on Android is not allowed, so **the Web Purchase Button will not appear on Android devices**. The [recent court ruling](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/apple-anti-steering-ruling-monetization-strategy/) only applies to U.S. iOS apps.
