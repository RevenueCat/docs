:::info Introduction
Read more about the new Web Purchase Button in our [blog post](https://revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons) announcement.
:::

RevenueCat Paywalls v2 allows you to modify Purchase Buttons to start the purchase flow through another store on the web. You can use [Web Billing](/web/web-billing/overview) through RevenueCat to create your own customizable web purchase flow, or add the URL to your own existing web purchase flow.

## Add a web purchase button

Add once UI has been updated.

## Purchase button options

| Option       | Behavior description | 
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| In-app purchase | If a package has an app product and a web product, the purchase button will start the in-app purchase flow.               |
| Web purchase | If a package has an app product and a web product, the purchase button will start the web purchase flow.              |
| Web product selection | The purchase button will open web product selection if more than one web product is offered. |
| Custom purchase | The purchase button will open your custom purchase flow with the Package ID and any enabled properties passed as URL parameters. |

:::info Packages must include products for the app being used
Even if you're only looking to direct customers to a web purchase flow, the packages on your paywall must include products for the app that the paywall is being viewed on in order to be displayed properly.
:::

## Custom purchase parameters

When using your own custom purchase flow, you'll have the option of passing the following parameters in the URL:
1. `rc_app_user_id` - The RevenueCat app user ID.
2. `rc_environment` - Whether the paywall is being viewed in a sandbox or production environment.
