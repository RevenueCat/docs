:::

RevenueCat Paywalls v2 supports the Web Purchase Button as a button destination as an alternative to the default purchase button. The Web Purchase Button opens an external link from your app to a [Web Billing](/web/web-billing/overview) paywall.

To add a Web Purchase Button to your paywall, you can use the Button component and select the 'Web Purchase' option.
