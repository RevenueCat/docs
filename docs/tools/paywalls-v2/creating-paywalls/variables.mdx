# Variables

For some Paywall strings you may want to set values based on the package thatâ€™s being displayed instead of hardcoding a single value, such as when quoting a price, or describing the duration of an Introductory Offer.

To make this easier and ensure accuracy, we recommend using **Variables** for these values that are package-specific.

For example, to describe a trial that offers "1 week free", you should use the `{{ product.offer_period_with_unit  }}` variable to insert `1 week` to ensure the string is accurate for any product you use, even if you make changes to the product or its introductory offer in the future.

We support the following variables:

| Variable                                   | Weekly Example    | Monthly Example   | 2 Month Example   | 3 Month Example   | 6 Month Example   | Annual Example    | Lifetime Example |

:::warning Variable preview values
The paywall preview is generated using our example values for each package listed above, and therefore will differ from the actual values for the product's you choose to present on your paywall.

To see a more accurate preview, we recommend running your application on your physical device or in the simulator, as this will present details based on the actual information for the products you're displaying on that device.

## FAQs

| Question     | Answer  |
| ------------------ | ------------------|
| How is the `product.relative_discount` variable calculated? |  `relative_discount` returns the localized discount percentage of a given package compared to the most expensive package per period that's offered on your paywall. For example, if you're displaying a monthly package that is $10/month, and a yearly package that is $80/year (or $6.67/month), the relative discount for the annual package is 67%. Because of this, we recommend only using this variable within packages that are NOT the most expensive package per period, as the most expensive package will have a null value returned, since its relative discount is null. |
