## Overview

Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries â€” all without any help from your support team.

## Features currently available

The Customer Center can be configured through the RevenueCat Dashboard, including advanced configuration of the JSON directly.

It can be used to allow customers to:

- Cancel active subscriptions
- Request refunds
- Change their subscription plans
- Restore previous purchases and contact your support email if they have trouble restoring

It can be used to allow developers to:

- Require customers to update their app if they are on an older version before being able to contact your support email
- Ask customers to provide the reason for their cancellation or refund request
- Automatically provide promo offers to retain customers

## Current limitations

- Only available on iOS 15+
- Limited visual configuration options in the dashboard, though advanced configuration is still supported via JSON. [Learn more.](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration#advanced-configuration)
- We are exposing a SwiftUI view and a modifier, but have not yet built a UIKit wrapper to help integrating on UIKit apps. This is on our roadmap.

## Concepts

### Paths

A path represents a unique subscription problem your customer might need to solve. Today we support:

- Cancellation
- Refund Request
- Plan Changes
- Missing Purchases

When a customer initially opens the Customer Center, these are the main options they'll see to select from.

### Feedback surveys

Any path can have a custom feedback survey attached to it with questions & answers that you define. You might use a survey simply to understand why a customer selected a given path (e.g. why they're looking to cancel), or you may use a survey to motivate them to change their mind with a compelling promotional offer.

### Promotional offers

Promotional offers are attachable to particular feedback survey options and to paths. We think you might be able to reduce churn if you capture customers who are looking for a way to make changes to their subscription if you offer them a discount at that exact time.
