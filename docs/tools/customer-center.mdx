Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries â€” all without any help from your support team.

:::tip
Customer Center is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy plan click [here](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing) to review your plan and consider upgrading.

## Features

The Customer Center can be configured through the RevenueCat Dashboard.

It can be used to allow customers to:

- Cancel active subscriptions
- Restore previous purchases and contact your support email if they have trouble restoring
- Link to external websites
- Link to other app sections using deeplinks
- Request refunds (iOS only)
- Change their subscription plans (iOS only)

It can be used to allow developers to:

- Require customers to update their app if they are on an older version before being able to contact your support email
- Ask customers to provide the reason for their cancellation or refund request (see [Configuring feedback prompts](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration#feedback-prompts-1) for more details)
- Automatically provide promo offers to retain customers (see [Configuring promo offers](/tools/customer-center/customer-center-configuration#promotional-offers-1) for more details)
