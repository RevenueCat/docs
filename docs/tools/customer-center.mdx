Customer Center is a self-service UI that can be added to your app to help your customers manage their subscriptions on their own. With it, you can prevent churn with pre-emptive promotional offers, capture actionable customer data with exit feedback prompts, and lower support volumes for common inquiries — all without any help from your support team.

:::tip
Customer Center is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy plan click [here](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing) to review your plan and consider upgrading.

## Features currently available

The Customer Center can be configured through the RevenueCat Dashboard.

It can be used to allow customers to:

- Cancel active subscriptions
- Request refunds (iOS only)
- Change their subscription plans (iOS only)
- Restore previous purchases and contact your support email if they have trouble restoring
- Link to external websites
- Link to other app sections using deeplinks

It can be used to allow developers to:

- Require customers to update their app if they are on an older version before being able to contact your support email
- Ask customers to provide the reason for their cancellation or refund request
- Automatically provide promo offers to retain customers

### Getting Started

Our paywall templates use native code to deliver smooth, intuitive experiences to your customers when you’re ready to deliver them an Offering; and you can use our Dashboard to pick the right template and configuration to meet your needs.

To use RevenueCat Paywalls, simply:

1. [Install the RevenueCat UI SDK](/tools/customer-center/installation)

2. [Create a Paywall](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls) on the Dashboard for the [Offering](/getting-started/entitlements) you intend to serve to your customers

3. See [displaying paywalls](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls) for how to display it into your app.

## Concepts

### Management options

There are 4 main management options that customers can choose from. Today we support:

- Cancellation
- Missing Purchases
- Refund Request (iOS only)
- Plan Changes (iOS only)

When a customer initially opens the Customer Center, these are the main options they'll see to select from.

### Feedback surveys

Any management option can have a custom feedback survey attached to it with a question & answers that you define. You might use a survey simply to understand why a customer selected a given path (e.g. why they're looking to cancel), or you may use a survey to motivate them to change their mind with a compelling promotional offer.

### Promotional offers

Promotional offers are attachable to particular feedback survey options and to paths. We think you might be able to reduce churn if you capture customers who are looking for a way to make changes to their subscription if you offer them a discount at that exact time.
