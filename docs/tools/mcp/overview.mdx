The RevenueCat MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server enables AI assistants to manage subscription apps, products, entitlements, and everything in-between without requiring direct dashboard access. This powerful tool provides 26 different capabilities for complete subscription management through natural language interactions.

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a standard that allows AI assistants to securely access external tools and data sources. The RevenueCat MCP server acts as a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude, GPT-4, etc.) and the RevenueCat API, enabling natural language interactions with your subscription infrastructure.
