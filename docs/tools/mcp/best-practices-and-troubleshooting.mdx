## Best Practices

### API Key Management

- **Use dedicated keys**: Create separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- **Principle of least privilege**: Use read-only keys when write access isn't needed
- **Regular rotation**: Periodically rotate your API keys for security

### Naming Conventions

- **Package identifiers**: Follow RevenueCat conventions:
  - `$rc_monthly` for monthly subscriptions
  - `$rc_annual` for annual subscriptions
  - `$rc_three_month`, `$rc_six_month` for other durations
  - `$rc_lifetime` for lifetime purchases
  - `$rc_custom_*` for custom packages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Issues

**Symptoms**: Authentication errors or "unauthorized" responses
**Solution**:

1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check key permissions (read vs write)
3. Ensure the key belongs to the correct project
4. Update your Authorization header with the correct API key

### Debug Information

For troubleshooting:

1. Test with simple commands like "Show me my project details"
2. Ensure API key has proper permissions in RevenueCat dashboard
3. Check your AI assistant's MCP connection logs

## Security Considerations

- **Use environment-specific keys**: Don't use production keys in development
- **Regular key rotation**: Change API keys periodically
- **Team access**: Use separate keys for each team member when possible
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly review API key usage in your RevenueCat dashboard
- **Secure storage**: Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control

## Error Handling

The MCP server provides detailed error responses including:

- Authentication errors for missing or invalid tokens
- API errors with full RevenueCat API response details
- Validation errors for invalid parameters

All errors are returned in a consistent format with `isError: true` and descriptive error messages.
