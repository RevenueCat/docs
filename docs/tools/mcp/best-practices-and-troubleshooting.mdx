## Best Practices

### API Key Management

- **Use dedicated keys**: Create separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- **Principle of least privilege**: Use read-only keys when write access isn't needed
- **Regular rotation**: Periodically rotate your API keys for security

### Naming Conventions

- **Package identifiers**: Follow RevenueCat conventions:
  - `$rc_monthly` for monthly subscriptions
  - `$rc_annual` for annual subscriptions
  - `$rc_three_month`, `$rc_six_month` for other durations
  - `$rc_lifetime` for lifetime purchases
  - `$rc_custom_*` for custom packages

### Workspace Organization (Local Extension)

- **One workspace per project**: Keep different RevenueCat projects in separate workspaces
- **Environment separation**: Use different API keys for different environments
- **Documentation**: Keep your `mcp.json` structure documented for team members

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### MCP Server Not Enabled (Local Extension)

**Symptoms**: No responses from RevenueCat commands in chat
**Solution**:

1. Go to **Cursor Settings â†’ MCP**
2. Click **Enable**
3. Click **Refresh**

#### MCP Server Disconnected

**Symptoms**: Previously working commands stop responding
**Solution**:

1. Go to **Cursor Settings â†’ MCP** (for local extension)
2. Click **Refresh**
3. If issues persist, reload the window

#### API Key Issues

**Symptoms**: Authentication errors or "unauthorized" responses
**Solution**:

1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check key permissions (read vs write)
3. Ensure the key belongs to the correct project
4. For local extension: Re-run `RevenueCat: Set Project Secret Key`
5. For cloud server: Update your Authorization header

#### Missing mcp.json (Local Extension)

**Symptoms**: Extension doesn't work after setting API key
**Solution**:

1. The extension should create `mcp.json` automatically
2. If missing, remove and re-add your API key
3. Check that the MCP server port is correctly configured

### Debug Information

For troubleshooting:

1. Check the VS Code Developer Console for debug logs (local extension)
2. Verify `mcp.json` contains the correct server configuration (local extension)
3. Test with simple commands like "Show me my project details"
4. Ensure API key has proper permissions in RevenueCat dashboard

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit `mcp.json`**: Always add it to `.gitignore` (local extension)
- **Use environment-specific keys**: Don't use production keys in development
- **Regular key rotation**: Change API keys periodically
- **Team access**: Use separate keys for each team member when possible
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly review API key usage in your RevenueCat dashboard

## Error Handling

Both deployment options provide detailed error responses including:

- Authentication errors for missing or invalid tokens
- API errors with full RevenueCat API response details
- Validation errors for invalid parameters

All errors are returned in a consistent format with `isError: true` and descriptive error messages.
