:::info Parent components
Parent components all fundamentally act as containers that can contain other components within them.
:::

## Common component properties

Most components have common properties such as padding, margin, border, and more that can be used to control their look and layout. To learn more about these common component properties, [click here.](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/component-properties)

## Text component

The text component allows you to enter custom strings to display on your paywall. These strings can be sized, formatted, aligned, and colored however you'd like using the available properties.

Text components can additionally be embedded in other parent components like stacks or buttons to position them relative to other components within the parent.

All text components support variables, which are dynamic values that will be set based on the package being referenced. When a text component is within a package, its variable values will always refer to that package; and text components outside of a package will always refer to the currently selected package.

[Learn more about variables.](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/variables)

In addition, all text components support having a unique value for customers that are eligible for intro offers, so that you can reference those offers anywhere on your paywall. You can set this value using the `Text field for an introductory offer` property on any text component.

[Learn more about setting unique values for customers eligible for intro offers.](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/customer-states)

### Custom fonts

Each text component can be configured to use a different font family of your preference. Fonts you can use include:

- System fonts
- Any of `sans-serif`, `serif`, or `monospace`
- Custom fonts you upload to RevenueCat

To upload a custom font, click the gear icon next to the font family property to open the font modal. From there, you can upload a font file, and then select it as the font family for any text component.

:::tip
Uploaded font files must be smaller than 5MB. We recommend keeping them under 2MB to ensure optimal loading performance.
:::

![Font modal](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-font-modal.png)

The available font weights in the paywall editor will be determined by the weights you upload for each font family, so be sure to upload each font weight you wish to use on your paywall.

The fonts you upload to to RevenueCat will be available to use in any text component on any paywall in your Project. When a paywall is displayed in your app for customers that uses a custom font, the font will be displayed directly from the file you've uploaded to RevenueCat.

:::info Improving font loading performance (highly recommended)
You can reduce loading times and improve performance by adding the font to your app's resources. To do this on Android, click the three horizontal dots to the left of the upload button in the font modal to open the modal for specifying each font family's resource name.
:::

### Font size

Each text component's font size can be set to one of the available options, or any other value you manually type in.

Though these values represent pixels when rendering the paywall in the dashboard preview, they will be rendered using density-independent values on each platform where the paywall is loaded (e.g. points on iOS, density-independent pixels [dp] on Android).

## Image component

The image component allows you to upload an image to display anywhere on your paywall.

Whenever you upload an image, we'll save it in a Media Gallery for your Project, allowing you to reuse it in any paywall.

:::tip
Uploaded images must be smaller than 2MB, and we recommend keeping them under 1MB, especially if your paywall is initialized very early in your onboarding flow, to ensure all images have been loaded by the time a customer visits the paywall.
:::

In addition to the standard properties that are common to other components, images have a few unique ones that can be used to more granularly control how your image is displayed.

### Fit mode

An image's fit mode can be set to `Fit` so it is resized to fit the available space without cropping, or `Fill`, where it will fill the available space and crop where necessary.

### Mask

An image's mask shape can be set to:

- Rectangle, with an optional corner radius setting
- Circle
- Concave
- Convex

### Overlay

An image can have a overlay applied of a solid color or a gradient, along with a transparency property, to allow you to do things like:

1. Add a background image with a semi-transparent overlay color that matches your app's branding
2. Apply a gradient overlay to smoothly transition from the image to your paywall's background color

### Alt text

Alt text can be configured for each image to make them more accessible.

To configure alt text, first open that image in the media gallery, which you can access by clicking on `Replace image` within an image component's properties. Then, hover of the image you want to edit and click the eye icon that appears to view its details.

![Image details](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-image-details.png)

Then, click `Edit` under Alt text to add descriptive text to the image, or to set it as a decorative image that does not require a description.

![Image details](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-alt-text.png)

## Icon component

The icon component allows you to add an icon to your paywall from our predefined list. Each icon has a filled and outlined version, and can have its color, size, border, etc. custom configured just like other components.

Unlike other components, icons must always have a fixed width and height. Each icon has a 1:1 aspect ratio, so we recommend keeping these values identical if you want to maintain the icon's inherent aspect ratio.

![Icon properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-icon-properties.png)

:::info Icons from Tabler
Paywalls uses an icon library from [Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons), which means you can also search for icons to use from their site. Some permutations are not available in RevenueCat, but if you see one you'd like to use let us know!
:::

## Stack

The stack component allows you to create a container of underlying components that can be jointly configured.

Stacks, and all other parent components, have position properties that determine how the child components are arranged within the parent. This allows you to control the axis on which those components are aligned, how they're aligned, how they're distributed, and the spacing between each child component.

![Stack properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-properties.png)

To add a component to a stack, click the `+` button in that stack's row in the Components Panel. You can also drag any existing component into a stack, or click the `...` button on existing component to `Embed in stack`, placing it within a new stack.

![Stack options](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-options.png)

## Footer

If you'd like to have a fixed footer at the bottom of your paywall, you can add one using the footer component. This is especially important if you want to add optional content to your paywall that a customer may want to explore if they're interested, but don't necessarily want things like the purchase button buried beneath that content.

Once added, the footer component will always be fixed to the bottom of your paywall, and its size will be relative to its properties and the size of the components within it.

To differentiate between your fixed footer and your other paywall content, we'll add a drop shadow to your footer by default, though this can be customized or removed if you'd prefer.

## Package

The package component allows you to add a package to your paywall which your customer may select to purchase. Since a package is a parent component, you can add any other components within it to style your package however you'd like.

At the top of the properties list, you'll need to select the package from your Offering that this package component should reference, and then decide whether this package should be selected by default when a customer loads your paywall.

![Package properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-package-properties.png)

In addition, package's are unique in that they can have both a **Default** and a **Selected** state configured for them, so that you can add unique styling to differentiate the two; such as a unique icon, border color, or background.

[Learn more about selected state styling.](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/customer-states)

:::tip
The package component defines the selectable area that a customer may tap on to select the package, so be sure to create suitable margin between it and other elements to make it easy for customers to tap on the correct package.
:::

## Purchase button

The purchase button is tied to your packages, and is how a customer begins the purchase process with the store.

It's shape can be configured as a pill, or a rectangle with a configurable border radius; and as a parent component it can also contain other components within it, which you might use to show multiple lines of text, an icon, etc.

### Web Purchase Button

To add an external link to a Web Paywall within your paywall in supported countries, you can use a Web Purchase Button. Learn more about the Web Purchase Button [here](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/web-purchase-button).

:::info Supported SDKs
The Web Purchase Button is currently supported in iOS 5.22.2, React Native 8.9.6, Flutter: 8.7.5, KMP: 1.7.7+13.29.1 and up.
:::

## Button

For all other buttons you may wish to add on your paywall, you can use the button component. The key difference between a button and other stacks is that it has configurable **Actions**.

You can choose from the following actions:

1. Restore Purchases
2. Navigate back
3. Navigate to

**Navigate to** additionally supports navigating to your Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, or any other custom URL of your choosing. URLs can be opened via In-App Browser, External Browser, or Deep Link.

## Carousel

The carousel component allows you to create a carousel of pages that a customer can swipe through. These pages are their own stacks, and therefore can contain almost any other components that are supported in Paywalls.

To control how pages are displayed in the carousel, you can configure the following properties:
- **Page spacing**: Determines the space separating each page in the carousel
- **Page peek**: Determines the portion of the prior and later pages which will be visible (if applicable)
- **Open on**: Determines which page will be open when the carousel is first displayed
- **Start again after last page (loop)**: Determines whether the carousel will loop back to the first page after the last page is reached
- **Automatically advance pages**: Determines whether the carousel will automatically advance to the next page after a configurable delay

![Carousel properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-v2-carousel-properties.png)

:::warning SDK compatibility
The earliest beta versions of our iOS SDK do not support the carousel component. We recommend updating to at least the [minimum recommended version](/tools/paywalls#required-sdk-versions) to get all fixes and improvements from the beta period.
:::

### Page control

Each carousel has a **Page control** component that allows you to customize the appearance of the controller, or if the individual **Indicators**. Page indicators can be modified to have a unique appearance based on whether they are in the default state or the active state.

![Page indicator properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-v2-page-indicator-properties.png)

In addition, the position of the page control component can be set to **Top** or **Bottom** via the carousel component.

## Timeline

The timeline component allows you to create a vertical stack of items that can be connected to simulate a timeline, or any other progression you want to illustrate.

To control how items are displayed in the timeline, you can configure the following properties:
- **Align icon**: Select between the icons being aligned with the **Title** or the **Title and description**
- Spacing of an **Item**: The vertical space between each item in the timeline
- Spacing of each **Title and description**: The vertical space between the title and description of each item
- Spacing of each **Column gutter**: The horizontal space between the vertically connected icons of each item and their text & description

Within each item component, you can configure the properties of its connector to control its width, vertical margin, and color.

:::tip Vertical margin of connectors
A connector's position begins and ends at the center of each icon it intersects with. If you want to instead set the connector to start or end before those points, add enough vertical margin to move its start or end point beyond the space covered by the icon.
:::

All items in a timeline must have an icon and a title, but the description field is optional and can be deleted if it is not desired. Each of those components can be configured individually, just as they can outside of a timeline.

![Timeline properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-v2-timeline-properties.png)

## Tabs

The tabs components allows you to add a tabbed interface to your paywall, which can be used to display different content in each tab; especially different package groups when offering multiple tiers of service, product types, etc.

### Managing tabs

Each tabs component contains:
1. A dropdown to select the tab to display & modify
2. A stack for that tab's content, which contains both:
3. The tab buttons, and
4. The content of the tab beneath the buttons

![Tabs component](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-tabs-component.png)

The dropdown allows you select which tab to display and modify. To add a new tab, you can either open the dropdown and select **+ Add tab**, or you can click the three horizontal dots to the right of the dropdown and select **Duplicate** to create a copy of the current tab.

### Tab buttons

The tab buttons stack allows you to control the styling of the tab selector. Changes to the tab buttons **will apply to all tabs**, to ensure a consistent user experience when switching between tabs.

Each tab has both a default and selected state which can be configured to have a unique appearance so that the user understands which tab is currently selected.

### Tab content

Each tab acts as a parent component which can contain any other components within it. In addition, any components within a tab can be duplicated to another tab to make designing each tab easier. Just click on the three horizontal dots to the right of a component within a tab to see the option to **Duplicate on** each additional tab.

:::info Package selected by default
Each tab can have its own package selected by default. This is the package which will be selected when the user first navigates to that tab.
:::

### Adding packages for each tab

The packages that you want to include on your paywall must all be included in the offering being used by the paywall. Instead of using RevenueCat's standard package identifiers (e.g. `$rc_annual`) when creating these packages, you may instead want to use custom package identifiers since (1) each package identifier must be unique and (2) you can then easily differentiate what's being offered by the identifier.

For example, your package structure may look like this:
- `basic_monthly`
- `basic_annual`
- `pro_monthly`
- `pro_annual`

Then, you can create tabs either for each entitlement (Basic and Pro), or for each period (monthly and annual), depending on how you want to present the options to your customers.

## Switch component

The switch component allows you to add a toggle to your paywall that can be used to let customers choose between two different sets of options. Switches are frequently used to offer a set of packages that do/don't offer a free trial, do/don't offer family sharing, etc.

To modify the appearance of all content within a switch, and have those appearance changes apply to both the OFF and ON state, you can use the `Switch` component in the components panel.

To modify the content within the OFF or ON state, use the `OFF content` and `ON content` components respectively.

After configuring one of the switch states to your liking, you can duplicate any of the components within the switch to the alternate state so that you have an easier starting point when modifying that other state.

:::info Switch component visualiation on device
The switch component will be displayed as a native switch element on both iOS and Android. The dashboard preview uses the iOS styling to illustrate the appearance, so expect the on device appearance to be different on Android in line with the native platform component.
:::

![Switch properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-switch.png)

### Adding packages for switch state

The packages that you want to include on your paywall must all be included in the offering being used by the paywall. Instead of using RevenueCat's standard package identifiers (e.g. `$rc_annual`) when creating these packages, you may instead want to use custom package identifiers since (1) each package identifier must be unique and (2) you can then easily differentiate what's being offered by the identifier.

For example, your package structure may look like this for a paywall using the switch component to offer a free trial toggle:
- `monthly_no_trial`
- `annual_no_trial`
- `monthly_with_trial`
- `annual_with_trial`

The `_no_trial` packages would represent the packages without a free trial, and the `_with_trial` packages would represent the packages with a free trial; so that you could place the first set in the switch's OFF content and the second set in the switch's ON content.

## Social proof, feature list, and awards

These component categories are pre-styled components from RevenueCat that can be used as starting points or inspiration to add this type of content to your paywall. Fundamentally, they are no different than any other stacks, and therefore can be customized and configured to your liking.
