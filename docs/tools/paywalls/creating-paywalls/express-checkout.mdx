The Express Checkout component allows you to offer quick purchase buttons like Apple Pay and Google Pay directly on your web paywall. This provides a more seamless, app-like purchasing experience for users on mobile devices from the web, similar to the native app experience.

## How it works

The Express Checkout component is designed to handle the different states of digital wallet availability. It contains three different stacks that you can customize:

- **Available stack**: Shown when a digital wallet (like Apple Pay or Google Pay) is supported and ready to use on the user's device and browser.
- **Unavailable stack**: Shown when no digital wallet is available. This allows you to show an alternative, like a standard purchase button, to ensure users can still complete their purchase.
- **Loading stack**: Shown while the SDK is determining if a digital wallet can be used.

## Wallet component

The Wallet component is a placeholder that automatically renders the appropriate digital wallet button (e.g., Apple Pay on iOS/Safari, Google Pay on Android/Chrome) based on the user's device and browser. 

It is typically placed inside the **Available stack** of an Express Checkout component. 

### Customizing the experience

By using the Wallet component alongside other components, you can customize how the express checkout option is presented. For example:

*   **In the Available stack**: You can show the Wallet component (Apple Pay/Google Pay) prominently, and perhaps a less emphasized "Regular Checkout" button below it.
*   **In the Unavailable stack**: You can show a standard Purchase Button that opens the full checkout flow.

This flexibility allows you to guide users toward the most seamless payment method when available, while always providing a fallback.

## Requirements

Express checkout is currently supported on web paywalls. To use it, ensure you have:
1. Configured Apple Pay and Google Pay in your Stripe account and registered your domains. See [Payment Methods](../../web/web-billing/payment-methods) for more details.
2. Added the **Express checkout** and **Wallet** components to your paywall in the Paywall Editor.
