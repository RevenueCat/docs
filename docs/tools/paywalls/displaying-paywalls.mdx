Use RevenueCat Paywalls to easily manage, display, and handle your paywall experiences across platforms.

## Key concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paywall display modes       | Various ways paywalls can be displayed, including: modal sheets, full-screen views, etc.       |
| Callbacks           | Events provided by the SDK to handle user interactions and outcomes (purchase completed, canceled, errors, etc.) |
| Restore behavior    | Automatic handling of purchase restoration within the paywall interface                                         |
| Error handling      | Managing scenarios where paywalls fail to load, purchases fail, or restores encounter issues                     |

## Display methods

RevenueCat Paywalls can be displayed in several ways to fit your application's UI/UX:

### Modal sheet

Modal sheets present the paywall in an overlay that can typically be swiped away by the user unless configured otherwise.

- **iOS (SwiftUI):**

```swift
.presentPaywallIfNeeded(requiredEntitlementIdentifier: "premium")
```

- **Android (Jetpack Compose):**

```kotlin
PaywallDialog.showIfNeeded(requiredEntitlementIdentifier = "premium")
```

### Full-screen view

Full-screen views offer an immersive experience by covering the entire screen.

- **iOS (SwiftUI):**

```swift
.presentPaywallIfNeeded(requiredEntitlementIdentifier: "premium")
    .presentationMode(.fullScreenCover)
```

- **iOS (UIKit):**

```swift
let paywallViewController = PaywallViewController(offeringIdentifier: "your_offering")
present(paywallViewController, animated: true)
```

- **Android (Compose):**

```kotlin
PaywallActivityLauncher.launch(context, offeringIdentifier = "your_offering")
```

### Hard paywall

Hard paywalls prevent dismissal unless the user makes a purchase or restores access. To present a hard paywall, you must:

1. Configure your paywall without dismiss or close buttons in the RevenueCat Paywall Editor
2. Present the paywall in a full-screen view (not as a dismissable sheet)

For example, in SwiftUI:

```swift
.presentPaywallIfNeeded(requiredEntitlementIdentifier: "premium")
    .presentationMode(.fullScreenCover)
```

### Embedded component

Embed paywalls within an existing screen or navigation stack for more integrated experiences.

- **React Native:**

```jsx
<RevenueCatUI.Paywall offeringIdentifier="your_offering" />
```

- **Flutter:**

```dart
PaywallView(offeringIdentifier: "your_offering")
```

- **Kotlin Multiplatform (Compose):**

```kotlin
Paywall(offeringIdentifier = "your_offering")
```

## Handling restore behavior

RevenueCat Paywalls handle restoring purchases seamlessly. Be sure to include a **Restore Purchases** button in your paywall design via the Paywall Editor to give your customers the ability to restore their purchases.

Restores automatically trigger callbacks (`onRestoreStarted`, `onRestoreCompleted`, `onRestoreError`). [Learn more about callbacks](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls#listening-to-callbacks).

### Automatic dismissal

The `presentPaywallIfNeeded` method supports passing an entitlement to achieve automatic dismissal behavior upon successful restoration. If the restored entitlement satisfies the paywall requirement, the paywall will automatically dismiss.

```swift
.presentPaywallIfNeeded(requiredEntitlementIdentifier: "premium") { result in
    switch result {
    case .restored(let customerInfo):
        print("Restored: \(customerInfo)")
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

### Manual dismissal

For other SDK methods of displaying paywalls, automatic dismissal upon entitlement restoration is not supported. Therefore, you need to listen for changes to `CustomerInfo` to determine if an entitlement has been granted and manually dismiss the paywall in your app's logic.

Example manual dismissal handling:

```swift
Purchases.shared.customerInfoStream.sink { customerInfo in
    if customerInfo.entitlements["premium"]?.isActive == true {
        dismissPaywall()
    }
}
```

## Paywall loading

Ensuring your paywalls load quickly provides a better user experience and reduces friction during the purchasing process. Follow these best practices:

- **Pre-fetch Offerings:** Load your offerings early in your app lifecycle to ensure that paywall data is readily available when needed.

```swift
Purchases.shared.getOfferings { offerings, error in
    if let offerings = offerings {
        print("Offerings loaded: \(offerings)")
    }
}
```

- **Reduce Asset Sizes:** Optimize and minimize asset sizes (images, fonts) used in your paywall design to ensure faster loading times.

- **Cache Data:** Utilize local caching mechanisms provided by RevenueCat SDKs to minimize network requests and improve loading speed.

- **Use SDK Latest Version:** Always keep your RevenueCat SDK up to date to benefit from performance improvements and optimizations.

## Handling errors

Manage paywall errors gracefully to ensure smooth user experience:

- **Paywall load failure:** Triggered if offerings fail to load. Handle by informing users or retrying.
- **Purchase errors:** Occur during transaction issues or cancellations. Notify users and allow retry.
- **Restore errors:** Handle by displaying an appropriate error message.

Example error handling in React Native:

```javascript
try {
  const result = await RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall();
  if (result === 'ERROR') {
    Alert.alert("Error loading paywall", "Please check your connection and try again.");
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

## Listening to callbacks

RevenueCat provides extensive callbacks for user interactions:

| Callback                | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onPurchaseStarted**   | Triggered when a purchase attempt begins.                       |
| **onPurchaseCompleted** | Called after successful purchase completion.                    |
| **onPurchaseCancelled** | Called if user cancels purchase.                                |
| **onPurchaseError**     | Triggered on transaction error.                                 |
| **onRestoreStarted**    | Fires when restore begins.                                      |
| **onRestoreCompleted**  | Called after successful restoration (even if nothing restored). |
| **onRestoreError**      | Triggered if restoration encounters an error.                   |
| **onDismiss**           | Fires when paywall is dismissed.                                |

Example SwiftUI callback implementation:

```swift
RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded(requiredEntitlementIdentifier: "premium") {
    purchaseCompleted: { customerInfo in
        unlockPremiumFeatures()
    },
    restoreCompleted: { customerInfo in
        updateUIForRestoredPurchases()
    },
    dismiss: {
        handlePaywallDismissal()
    }
}
```
