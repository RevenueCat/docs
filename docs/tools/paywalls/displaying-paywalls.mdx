| Error handling      | Managing scenarios where paywalls fail to load, purchases fail, or restores encounter issues                     |

## Display methods

RevenueCat Paywalls can be displayed in several ways to fit your application's UI/UX:

### Modal sheet

Modal sheets present the paywall in an overlay that can typically be swiped away by the user unless configured otherwise.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "iOS (SwiftUI)",
        content: modalSheetSwiftUI,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Android (Jetpack Compose)",
        content: modalSheetAndroid,
    },
]}/>

#### Paywalls on iPad

When using `presentPaywallIfNeeded` to display a paywall on iPad, we'll automatically show a paywall in a modal that is roughly iPhone sized. If instead you prefer to show a paywall that is full screen on iPad, you can use the methods described below.

![Paywalls on iPad](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-on-ipad.jpeg)

### Full-screen view

Full-screen views offer an immersive experience by covering the entire screen.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "iOS (SwiftUI)",
        content: fullscreenSwiftUI,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "iOS (UIKit)",
        content: fullscreenUIKit,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Android (Compose)",
        content: fullscreenAndroid,
    },
]}/>

### Hard paywall

Hard paywalls prevent dismissal unless the user makes a purchase or restores access. To present a hard paywall, you must:

1. Configure your paywall without dismiss or close buttons in the RevenueCat Paywall Editor
2. Present the paywall in a full-screen view (not as a dismissable sheet)

For example, in SwiftUI:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: hardPaywallSwiftUI,
    },
]}/>

### Embedded component

Embed paywalls within an existing screen or navigation stack for more integrated experiences.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'jsx',
        title: "React Native",
        content: embeddedReactNative,
    },
    {
        type: 'dart',
        title: "Flutter",
        content: embeddedFlutter,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Kotlin Multiplatform (Compose)",
        content: embeddedKMP,
    },
]}/>

## Handling restore behavior

RevenueCat Paywalls handle restoring purchases seamlessly. Be sure to include a **Restore Purchases** button in your paywall design via the Paywall Editor to give your customers the ability to restore their purchases.

Restores automatically trigger callbacks (`onRestoreStarted`, `onRestoreCompleted`, `onRestoreError`). [Learn more about callbacks](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls#listening-to-callbacks).

### Automatic dismissal

The `presentPaywallIfNeeded` method supports passing an entitlement to achieve automatic dismissal behavior upon successful restoration. If the restored entitlement satisfies the paywall requirement, the paywall will automatically dismiss.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: automaticDismissal,
    },
]}/>

### Manual dismissal

For other SDK methods of displaying paywalls, automatic dismissal upon entitlement restoration is not supported. Therefore, you need to listen for changes to `CustomerInfo` to determine if an entitlement has been granted and manually dismiss the paywall in your app's logic.

Example manual dismissal handling:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: manualDismissal,
    },
]}/>

## Paywall loading

Ensuring your paywalls load quickly provides a better user experience and reduces friction during the purchasing process. Follow these best practices:

- **Pre-fetch Offerings:** Load your offerings early in your app lifecycle to ensure that paywall data is readily available when needed.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: prefetchOfferings,
    },
]}/>

- **Reduce Asset Sizes:** Optimize and minimize asset sizes (images, fonts) used in your paywall design to ensure faster loading times.

- **Cache Data:** Utilize local caching mechanisms provided by RevenueCat SDKs to minimize network requests and improve loading speed.

- **Use SDK Latest Version:** Always keep your RevenueCat SDK up to date to benefit from performance improvements and optimizations.

## Handling errors

Manage paywall errors gracefully to ensure smooth user experience:

- **Paywall load failure:** Triggered if offerings fail to load. Handle by informing users or retrying.
- **Purchase errors:** Occur during transaction issues or cancellations. Notify users and allow retry.
- **Restore errors:** Handle by displaying an appropriate error message.

Example error handling in React Native:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'javascript',
        title: "React Native",
        content: errorHandling,
    },
]}/>

## Listening to callbacks

RevenueCat provides extensive callbacks for user interactions:

| Callback                | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onPurchaseStarted**   | Triggered when a purchase attempt begins.                       |
| **onPurchaseCompleted** | Called after successful purchase completion.                    |
| **onPurchaseCancelled** | Called if user cancels purchase.                                |
| **onPurchaseError**     | Triggered on transaction error.                                 |
| **onRestoreStarted**    | Fires when restore begins.                                      |
| **onRestoreCompleted**  | Called after successful restoration (even if nothing restored). |
| **onRestoreError**      | Triggered if restoration encounters an error.                   |
| **onDismiss**           | Fires when paywall is dismissed.                                |

Example SwiftUI callback implementation:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: callbacksSwiftUI,
    },
]}/>

## Custom fonts

Using custom fonts in your paywall can now be done by uploading font files directly to RevenueCat. See the [Custom fonts](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#custom-fonts) section for more information.

### Including custom fonts in your app

To improve the performance and reduce loading times of your paywall using custom fonts, you can also add the font to your app's resources using the instructions below.

#### Android

To add a custom font to your Android app, place the font file in the `res/font` folder. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/text-and-emoji/fonts-in-xml) for more information.

#### iOS

To add a custom font to your iOS app, go to _File_ and then _Add Files to "Your Project Name"_. The font file should be a target member of your app, and be registered with iOS by adding the "Fonts provided by the application" key to your _Info.plist_ file. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/adding-a-custom-font-to-your-app) for more information.

#### Kotlin Multiplatform, React Native, and Flutter

Adding custom fonts to a hybrid app involves adding the font files to the underlying Android and iOS projects following the instructions above.

## Changes from legacy Paywalls

#### Footer Paywalls

Our current Paywalls no longer support footer Paywalls. If your app requests the Paywall for an Offering to display that has a current Paywall, it will display a default version of that paywall instead (see below). Footer mode can still be used on legacy Paywalls templates using the existing method, or the new `.originalTemplatePaywallFooter()` method on SDK versions that support our current Paywalls.

#### Close buttons

Our current Paywalls do not require the `displayCloseButton` parameter (or equivalent for other platforms), and it will have no effect if used, since close buttons can be optionally added directly to your paywall as a component if desired.

#### Font provider

Our current Paywalls do not support passing in a custom font provider as legacy Paywalls did. Instead, you can now configure Paywalls to use the fonts you've already installed in your app directly from the Dashboard. Using the original handler will have no effect on current Paywalls. For more information, [click here](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#custom-fonts)

## Default Paywall

If you attempt to display a Paywall for an Offering that doesn't have one configured, or that has a Paywall configured which is not supported on the installed SDK version, the RevenueCatUI SDK will display a default Paywall.

The default paywall displays all packages in the Offering.

On iOS it uses the app's `accentColor` for styling.
On Android, it uses the app's `Material3`'s `ColorScheme`.

:::tip Targeting
If your app supports our legacy Paywall templates, consider using Targeting to create an audience that only receives your new Paywall if they're using an SDK version that does not support our current Paywalls. This will ensure that older app versions continue to receive the Offering and Paywall that they support, while any app versions running a supported RC SDK version receive your new Paywall.
