## Key concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paywall display modes       | Various ways paywalls can be displayed, including: modal sheets, full-screen views, etc.       |
| Callbacks           | Events provided by the SDK to handle user interactions and outcomes (purchase completed, canceled, errors, etc.) |
| Restore behavior    | Automatic handling of purchase restoration within the paywall interface                                         |
| Error handling      | Managing scenarios where paywalls fail to load, purchases fail, or restores encounter issues                     |

## Display methods

RevenueCat Paywalls can be displayed in several ways to fit your application's UI/UX:

### Modal sheet

Modal sheets present the paywall in an overlay that can typically be swiped away by the user unless configured otherwise.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "iOS (SwiftUI)",
        content: modalSheetSwiftUI,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Android (Jetpack Compose)",
        content: modalSheetAndroid,
    },
]}/>

### Full-screen view

Full-screen views offer an immersive experience by covering the entire screen.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "iOS (SwiftUI)",
        content: fullscreenSwiftUI,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "iOS (UIKit)",
        content: fullscreenUIKit,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Android (Compose)",
        content: fullscreenAndroid,
    },
]}/>

### Hard paywall

Hard paywalls prevent dismissal unless the user makes a purchase or restores access. To present a hard paywall, you must:

1. Configure your paywall without dismiss or close buttons in the RevenueCat Paywall Editor
2. Present the paywall in a full-screen view (not as a dismissable sheet)

For example, in SwiftUI:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: hardPaywallSwiftUI,
    },
]}/>

### Embedded component

Embed paywalls within an existing screen or navigation stack for more integrated experiences.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'jsx',
        title: "React Native",
        content: embeddedReactNative,
    },
    {
        type: 'dart',
        title: "Flutter",
        content: embeddedFlutter,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Kotlin Multiplatform (Compose)",
        content: embeddedKMP,
    },
]}/>

## Handling restore behavior

RevenueCat Paywalls handle restoring purchases seamlessly. Be sure to include a **Restore Purchases** button in your paywall design via the Paywall Editor to give your customers the ability to restore their purchases.

Restores automatically trigger callbacks (`onRestoreStarted`, `onRestoreCompleted`, `onRestoreError`). [Learn more about callbacks](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls#listening-to-callbacks).

### Automatic dismissal

The `presentPaywallIfNeeded` method supports passing an entitlement to achieve automatic dismissal behavior upon successful restoration. If the restored entitlement satisfies the paywall requirement, the paywall will automatically dismiss.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: automaticDismissal,
    },
]}/>

### Manual dismissal

For other SDK methods of displaying paywalls, automatic dismissal upon entitlement restoration is not supported. Therefore, you need to listen for changes to `CustomerInfo` to determine if an entitlement has been granted and manually dismiss the paywall in your app's logic.

Example manual dismissal handling:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: manualDismissal,
    },
]}/>

## Paywall loading

Ensuring your paywalls load quickly provides a better user experience and reduces friction during the purchasing process. Follow these best practices:

- **Pre-fetch Offerings:** Load your offerings early in your app lifecycle to ensure that paywall data is readily available when needed.

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: prefetchOfferings,
    },
]}/>

- **Reduce Asset Sizes:** Optimize and minimize asset sizes (images, fonts) used in your paywall design to ensure faster loading times.

- **Cache Data:** Utilize local caching mechanisms provided by RevenueCat SDKs to minimize network requests and improve loading speed.

- **Use SDK Latest Version:** Always keep your RevenueCat SDK up to date to benefit from performance improvements and optimizations.

## Handling errors

Manage paywall errors gracefully to ensure smooth user experience:

- **Paywall load failure:** Triggered if offerings fail to load. Handle by informing users or retrying.
- **Purchase errors:** Occur during transaction issues or cancellations. Notify users and allow retry.
- **Restore errors:** Handle by displaying an appropriate error message.

Example error handling in React Native:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'javascript',
        title: "React Native",
        content: errorHandling,
    },
]}/>

## Listening to callbacks

RevenueCat provides extensive callbacks for user interactions:

| Callback                | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **onPurchaseStarted**   | Triggered when a purchase attempt begins.                       |
| **onPurchaseCompleted** | Called after successful purchase completion.                    |
| **onPurchaseCancelled** | Called if user cancels purchase.                                |
| **onPurchaseError**     | Triggered on transaction error.                                 |
| **onRestoreStarted**    | Fires when restore begins.                                      |
| **onRestoreCompleted**  | Called after successful restoration (even if nothing restored). |
| **onRestoreError**      | Triggered if restoration encounters an error.                   |
| **onDismiss**           | Fires when paywall is dismissed.                                |

Example SwiftUI callback implementation:

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "SwiftUI",
        content: callbacksSwiftUI,
    },
]}/>
