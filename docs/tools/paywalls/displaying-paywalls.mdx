## Platform specific instructions

### iOS

RevenueCat Paywalls will show paywalls in a sheet or fullscreen on iPhone, and there are multiple ways to do this with SwiftUI and UIKit.

- Depending on an entitlement with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Custom logic with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- Manually with `PaywallView` or `PaywallViewController`

import swift1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.swift?raw';
import swift2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.swift?raw';
import swift3 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3_new.swift?raw';
import swift4 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.swift?raw';
import objc5 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_5.m?raw';

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: swift1,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: swift2,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually",
        content: swift3,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually (UIKit)",
        content: swift4,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        title: "Manually (UIKit and Objective-C)",
        content: objc5,
    },

]}/>

#### Paywalls on iPad
When using `presentPaywallIfNeeded` to display a paywall on iPad, we'll automatically show a paywall in a modal that is roughly iPhone sized. If instead you prefer to show a paywall that is full screen on iPad, you can use the `PaywallView` or `PaywallViewController` methods instead.

### Android

RevenueCat Paywalls will, by default, show paywalls fullscreen and there are multiple ways to do this with `Activity`s and Jetpack Compose.

- Depending on an entitlement with `PaywallDialog`
- Custom logic with `PaywallDialog`
- Manually with `Paywall`, `PaywallDialog`, or `PaywallActivityLauncher`

import kotlin1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.kt?raw';
import kotlin2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.kt?raw';
import kotlin3 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3.kt?raw';
import kotlin4 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.kt?raw';
import paywallsActivityJava from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_activity_java.java?raw';

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: kotlin1,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: kotlin2,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Manually",
        content: kotlin3,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Manually (Activity)",
        content: kotlin4,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        title: "Manually (Activity) - Java",
        content: paywallsActivityJava,
    }

]}/>

### React Native

There are several ways to present paywalls:

- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall`: this will display a paywall when invoked.
- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded`: this will present a paywall only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- Manually presenting `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>`: this gives you more flexibility on how the paywall is presented.

import rn1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_1.ts.txt?raw';
import rn2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_2_new.ts.txt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "rn",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall",
      content: rn1,
    },
    {
      type: "rn",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.Paywall",
      content: rn2,
    },
  ]}
/>

There are also several listeners that can be used to handle the paywall lifecycle, such as `onPurchaseStarted`, `onPurchaseCompleted`, and `onRestoreStarted`.

#### Listeners

When using `RevenueCatUI.Paywall`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions.

Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onPurchaseCancelled
- onRestoreStarted
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError
- onDismiss

### Flutter

There are several ways to present paywalls:

- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall`: this will display a paywall when invoked.
- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded`: this will present a paywall only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- Manually presenting `PaywallView`: this gives you more flexibility on how the paywall is presented.

import flutter1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_1.dart?raw';
import flutter2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_2_new.dart?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "flutter",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall",
      content: flutter1,
    },
    {
      type: "flutter",
      title: "PaywallView",
      content: flutter2,
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Listeners

When using `PaywallView`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions.
Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError
- onDismiss

### Kotlin Multiplatform

You can present a fullscreen Paywall using the `Paywall` composable. You have the flexibility to decide when to call this. You could, for instance, add it to your navigation graph.

import kmp1 from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_kmp_1_new.kts?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "kotlin",
      title: "Paywall",
      content: kmp1,
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Listeners

When using `Paywall`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions.
Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onPurchaseCancelled
- onRestoreStarted
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError

### Capacitor

There are several ways to present paywalls:

- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall`: this will display a paywall when invoked.
- Using `RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded`: this will present a paywall only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.

import cap1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_cap_1.ts.txt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "capacitor",
      title: "RevenueCatUI.presentPaywall",
      content: cap1,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Unity

RevenueCat Paywalls for Unity provide native paywall presentation on iOS and Android with simple C# APIs.

There are several ways to present paywalls:

- Using `PaywallsPresenter.Present()`: this will display a paywall when invoked.
- Using `PaywallsPresenter.PresentIfNeeded()`: this will present a paywall only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- Using `PaywallsBehaviour` component: configure paywalls through Unity's Inspector for Editor workflows.

import unity1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_unity_1.cs?raw';
import unity2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_unity_2.cs?raw';
import unity3 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_unity_3.cs?raw';
import RCCodeBlock from '@site/src/components/RCCodeBlock';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "unity",
      title: "PaywallsPresenter.Present",
      content: unity1,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      title: "PaywallsPresenter.PresentIfNeeded",
      content: unity2,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      title: "PaywallOptions",
      content: unity3,
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Using PaywallsBehaviour Component

For developers who prefer configuring paywalls through Unity's Inspector, you can use the `PaywallsBehaviour` MonoBehaviour component:

1. Add a `PaywallsBehaviour` component to any GameObject
2. Configure the options in the Inspector:
   - **Offering Identifier**: Leave empty to use current offering, or specify an offering ID
   - **Display Close Button**: Whether to show a close button (original templates only)
   - **Required Entitlement Identifier**: Optional - paywall will only show if user lacks this entitlement
3. Wire up UnityEvent callbacks: `OnPurchased`, `OnRestored`, `OnCancelled`, `OnNotPresented`, `OnError`
4. Call `PresentPaywall()` method (e.g., from a UI Button's OnClick event)

#### Platform Notes

- The paywall UI is only available on iOS and Android device builds.
- Unity Editor is not supported for displaying the paywall UI.
- Build to device when testing the paywall UI.

## Handling paywall navigation

When creating a paywall, consider whether it will be presented in a sheet, or as a full screen view. Sheets won't require a dedicated close button. Full screen views should have either a close button (if presented modally) or a back button (if part of a navigation stack or host) unless you intend to provide a hard paywall to your customers that cannot be bypassed.

## Setting preferred locale

You can set a preferred locale for your paywalls to display in a specific language. This is useful when you want to override the device's default language for paywall content.

import preferredLocaleSwift from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_preferred_locale_1.swift?raw';
import preferredLocaleKotlin from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_preferred_locale_2.kt?raw';
import preferredLocaleReactNative from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_preferred_locale_3.ts.txt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: preferredLocaleSwift, name: "iOS" },
    { type: "kotlin", content: preferredLocaleKotlin, name: "Android" },
    { type: "rn", content: preferredLocaleReactNative, name: "React Native" }
  ]}
/>


## Custom fonts
 
Using custom fonts in your paywall can now be done by uploading font files directly to RevenueCat. See the [Custom fonts](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#custom-fonts) section for more information.

### Including custom fonts in your app

To improve the performance and reduce loading times of your paywall using custom fonts, you can add the font to your app's resources using the instructions below.

#### Android
To add a custom font to your Android app, place the font file in the `res/font` folder. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/text-and-emoji/fonts-in-xml) for more information.

#### iOS
To add a custom font to your iOS app, go to _File_ and then _Add Files to “Your Project Name”_. The font file should be a target member of your app, and be registered with iOS by adding the "Fonts provided by the application" key to your _Info.plist_ file. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/adding-a-custom-font-to-your-app) for more information.

#### Kotlin Multiplatform, React Native, and Flutter
Adding custom fonts to a hybrid app involves adding the font files to the underlying Android and iOS projects following the instructions above.

## Changes from legacy Paywalls

#### Footer Paywalls

Our current Paywalls no longer support footer Paywalls. If your app requests the Paywall for an Offering to display that has a current Paywall, it will display a default version of that paywall instead (see below). Footer mode can still be used on legacy Paywalls templates using the existing method, or the new `.originalTemplatePaywallFooter()` method on SDK versions that support our current Paywalls.

#### Close buttons

Our current Paywalls do not require the `displayCloseButton` parameter (or equivalent for other platforms), and it will have no effect if used, since close buttons can be optionally added directly to your paywall as a component if desired.

#### Font provider

Our current Paywalls do not support passing in a custom font provider as legacy Paywalls did. Instead, you can now configure Paywalls to use the fonts you've already installed in your app directly from the Dashboard. Using the original handler will have no effect on current Paywalls. For more information, [click here](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#custom-fonts)

## Default Paywall

If you attempt to display a Paywall for an Offering that doesn't have one configured, or that has a Paywall configured which is not supported on the installed SDK version, the RevenueCatUI SDK will display a default Paywall.

The default paywall displays all packages in the Offering.

On iOS it uses the app's `accentColor` for styling.
On Android, it uses the app's `Material3`'s `ColorScheme`.

:::tip Targeting
If your app supports our legacy Paywall templates, consider using Targeting to create an audience that only receives your new Paywall if they're using an SDK version that does not support our current Paywalls. This will ensure that older app versions continue to receive the Offering and Paywall that they support, while any app versions running a supported RC SDK version receive your new Paywall.
