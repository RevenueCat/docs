## Default Paywall

If you attempt to display a Paywall for an Offering that doesn't have one configured, or that has a Paywall configured which is not supported on the installed SDK version, the RevenueCatUI SDK will display a default Paywall.

The default paywall displays all packages in the Offering.

On iOS it uses the app's `accentColor` for styling.
On Android, it uses the app's `Material3`'s `ColorScheme`.

:::tip Targeting
If your app supports our legacy Paywall templates, consider using Targeting to create an audience that only receives your new Paywall if they're using an SDK version that does not support our current Paywalls. This will ensure that older app versions continue to receive the Offering and Paywall that they support, while any app versions running a supported RC SDK version receive your new Paywall.

## Platform specific instructions

Choose your platform below for code and guidance on how to display paywalls. Each section covers the main presentation options (e.g. entitlement-based, custom logic, or manual presentation) for that platform.

- [iOS](#ios)
- [Android](#android)
- [React Native](#react-native)
- [Flutter](#flutter)
- [Kotlin Multiplatform](#kotlin-multiplatform)
- [Capacitor](#capacitor)
- [Unity](#unity)
- [Web](#web)

### iOS

RevenueCat Paywalls work on iPhone, iPad, and Mac (including Mac Catalyst). You can show paywalls in a sheet or fullscreen using SwiftUI or UIKit:

- **Entitlement:** Show the paywall only when the user lacks an entitlement, with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- **Custom Logic:** Custom Logic with `presentPaywallIfNeeded`
- **Manually:** With `PaywallView` (SwiftUI), or `PaywallViewController` (UIKit in Swift or Objective-C)

import swift1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.swift?raw';
import swift2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.swift?raw';
import swift3 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3_new.swift?raw';
import swift4 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.swift?raw';
import objc5 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_5.m?raw';

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: swift1,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: swift2,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually (SwiftUI)",
        content: swift3,
    },
    {
        type: 'swift',
        title: "Manually (UIKit)",
        content: swift4,
    },
    {
        type: 'objc',
        title: "Manually (UIKit and Objective-C)",
        content: objc5,
    },

]}/>

:::info Objective-C sample
The Objective-C sample may show parameters such as `displayCloseButton` that have no effect on [current Paywalls](#changes-from-legacy-paywalls). Close buttons are configured in the paywall template. The pattern (create controller, set delegate, present) is correct; see the SDK reference for the latest initializer.
:::

For purchase and restore callbacks, use the `PaywallViewControllerDelegate` (UIKit) or the view modifiers on `PaywallView` (SwiftUI).

#### Paywalls on iPad
The approaches above work on iPad as well. When you use `presentPaywallIfNeeded` on iPad, we show the paywall in a compact, iPhone-sized modal. If you prefer a full-screen paywall on iPad, use the **Manually** approach with `PaywallView` or `PaywallViewController` instead.

</figure>

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### Android

RevenueCat Paywalls will, by default, show paywalls fullscreen and there are multiple ways to do this with `Activity` and Jetpack Compose.

- **Entitlement:** Show the paywall only when the user lacks an entitlement, with `PaywallDialog`
- **Custom Logic:** Custom Logic with `PaywallDialog`
- **Manually:** With `Paywall` (Compose), or `PaywallActivityLauncher` (Activity in Kotlin or Java)

import kotlin1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.kt?raw';
import kotlin2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_2.kt?raw';
import kotlin3 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_3.kt?raw';
import kotlin4 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_4.kt?raw';
import paywallsActivityJava from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_activity_java.java?raw';

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Entitlement",
        content: kotlin1,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Custom Logic",
        content: kotlin2,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Manually (Compose)",
        content: kotlin3,
    },
    {
        type: 'kotlin',
        title: "Manually (Activity - Kotlin)",
        content: kotlin4,
    },
    {
        type: 'java',
        title: "Manually (Activity - Java)",
        content: paywallsActivityJava,
    }

]}/>

For purchase and restore callbacks, use the `PaywallListener` interface (Compose) or `PaywallResultHandler` (Activity).

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### React Native

RevenueCat Paywalls for React Native can be presented in two main ways:

- **presentPaywall / presentPaywallIfNeeded:** Display a paywall when invoked, or only when the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- **Manually:** Use the `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>` component in your UI for full control over layout and presentation.

import rn1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_1.ts.txt?raw';
import rn2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_2_new.ts.txt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "rn",
      title: "presentPaywall / presentPaywallIfNeeded",
      content: rn1,
    },
    {
      type: "rn",
      title: "Paywall (manual)",
      content: rn2,
    },
  ]}
/>

For purchase and restore callbacks, use the listeners below (when using `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>`) or handle the result from `presentPaywall` / `presentPaywallIfNeeded`.

#### Listeners

When using `RevenueCatUI.Paywall`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions (for example, `onPurchaseStarted`, `onPurchaseCompleted`, and `onRestoreStarted`).

Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onPurchaseCancelled
- onRestoreStarted
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError
- onDismiss

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### Flutter

RevenueCat Paywalls for Flutter can be presented in two main ways:

- **presentPaywall / presentPaywallIfNeeded:** Display a paywall when invoked, or only when the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.
- **Manually:** Use `PaywallView` in your widget tree for full control over layout and presentation.

import flutter1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_1.dart?raw';
import flutter2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_2_new.dart?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "flutter",
      title: "presentPaywall / presentPaywallIfNeeded",
      content: flutter1,
    },
    {
      type: "flutter",
      title: "PaywallView (manual)",
      content: flutter2,
    },
  ]}
/>

For purchase and restore callbacks when using `PaywallView`, use the listeners below. When using `presentPaywall` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded`, handle the returned result.

#### Listeners

When using `PaywallView`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions (for example, `onPurchaseStarted`, `onPurchaseCompleted`, and `onRestoreCompleted`).
Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError
- onDismiss

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### Kotlin Multiplatform

RevenueCat Paywalls for Kotlin Multiplatform use the `Paywall` composable. Add it to your navigation graph or present it when needed.

- **Paywall:** Use the `Paywall` composable in your UI (e.g. in your navigation graph) for full control over when and where the paywall appears.

import kmp1 from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_kmp_1_new.kts?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "kotlin",
      title: "Paywall",
      content: kmp1,
    },
  ]}
/>

For purchase and restore callbacks, use the listeners below.

#### Listeners

When using `Paywall`, you may use one of the provided listeners to react to user actions (for example, `onPurchaseStarted`, `onPurchaseCompleted`, and `onRestoreCompleted`).
Available listeners at this time are:

- onPurchaseStarted
- onPurchaseCompleted
- onPurchaseError
- onPurchaseCancelled
- onRestoreStarted
- onRestoreCompleted
- onRestoreError

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### Capacitor

RevenueCat Paywalls for Capacitor can be presented in two main ways:

- **presentPaywall / presentPaywallIfNeeded:** Display a paywall when invoked, or only when the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement.

import cap1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_cap_1.ts.txt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "capacitor",
      title: "presentPaywall / presentPaywallIfNeeded",
      content: cap1,
    },
  ]}
/>

For purchase and restore callbacks, handle the returned result from `presentPaywall` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded`.

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### Unity

RevenueCat Paywalls for Unity provide native paywall presentation on iOS and Android with simple C# APIs.

- **Present:** Display a paywall when invoked with `PaywallsPresenter.Present()`.
- **PresentIfNeeded:** Present only if the customer does not have an unlocked entitlement with `PaywallsPresenter.PresentIfNeeded()`.
- **PaywallOptions / PaywallsBehaviour:** Use `PaywallOptions` in code for options, or the `PaywallsBehaviour` component in the Inspector (see below).

import unity1 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_unity_1.cs?raw';
import unity2 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_unity_2.cs?raw';
import unity3 from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_unity_3.cs?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "unity",
      title: "Present",
      content: unity1,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      title: "PresentIfNeeded",
      content: unity2,
    },
    {
      type: "unity",
      title: "PaywallOptions",
      content: unity3,
    },
  ]}
/>

For callbacks, use the result from `Present()` / `PresentIfNeeded()` or wire up UnityEvent callbacks on `PaywallsBehaviour` (see below).

#### Using PaywallsBehaviour Component

For developers who prefer configuring paywalls through Unity's Inspector, you can use the `PaywallsBehaviour` MonoBehaviour component:

1. Add a `PaywallsBehaviour` component to any GameObject
2. Configure the options in the Inspector:
   - **Offering Identifier**: Leave empty to use current offering, or specify an offering ID
   - **Display Close Button**: Whether to show a close button (original templates only)
   - **Required Entitlement Identifier**: Optional - paywall will only show if user lacks this entitlement
3. Wire up UnityEvent callbacks: `OnPurchased`, `OnRestored`, `OnCancelled`, `OnNotPresented`, `OnError`
4. Call `PresentPaywall()` method (e.g., from a UI Button's OnClick event)

#### Platform Notes

- The paywall UI is only available on iOS and Android device builds.
- Unity Editor is not supported for displaying the paywall UI.
- Build to device when testing the paywall UI.

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

### Web

RevenueCat Paywalls on the web are supported through [Web Billing](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/web-billing/paywalls). You can serve a paywall via a Web Purchase Link or embed it in your site using the [purchases-js SDK](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/web-billing/web-sdk).

- **Web Purchase Link:** Serve your paywall to customers via a link; [learn more](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/web-billing/paywalls).
- **purchases-js:** Call `presentPaywall` with the element that should host the paywall; optionally pass an offering from `purchases.getOfferings()`. The SDK renders the paywall, runs the purchase, and resolves with the result.

```ts title="Presenting a paywall from purchases-js"
async function showPaywall() {
  const paywallContainer = document.getElementById("paywall-container");
  try{
      const purchaseResult = await purchases.presentPaywall({
        htmlTarget: paywallContainer,
        // no offering specified – defaults to the current offering
      });
      console.log("Purchase completed", purchaseResult);
  } catch (e){
      console.log("Something went wrong while purchasing through Paywalls");
  }
}
```

If you omit the `offering` parameter (or pass `undefined`), the paywall from the offering marked as `current` will be displayed.

You can also specify an offering by passing it as parameter to `presentPaywall`.
```ts title="Presenting a paywall from purchases-js with a specific offering"
async function showPaywall() {
  const offerings = await purchases.getOfferings();
  const offeringToUse= offerings.all['offeringIdToUse'];
  const paywallContainer = document.getElementById("paywall-container");
  try{
      const purchaseResult = await purchases.presentPaywall({
        htmlTarget: paywallContainer,
        offering: offeringToUse
      });
      console.log("Purchase completed", purchaseResult);
  } catch (e){
      console.log("Something went wrong while purchasing through Paywalls");
  }
}
```

:::info Max width
Paywalls on the web have a maximum width of 968px.
Individual components can be configured to have their own width settings within that max width of the paywall itself.

When used in Web Purchase Links, if the window the paywall is being displayed in is wider than 968px, the additional space will be filled based on the specified background color of your WPL. [Learn more](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/web-billing/web-purchase-links)
:::

For full details on the classes, methods, and listeners above, see the [SDK Reference](/platform-resources/sdk-reference).

## Common topics

### Handling paywall navigation

When creating a paywall, consider whether it will be presented in a sheet, or as a full screen view. Sheets won't require a dedicated close button. Full screen views should have either a close button (if presented modally) or a back button (if part of a navigation stack or host) unless you intend to provide a hard paywall to your customers that cannot be bypassed.

### Setting preferred locale

You can set a preferred locale for your paywalls to display in a specific language. This is useful when you want to override the device's default language for paywall content.

import preferredLocaleSwift from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_preferred_locale_1.swift?raw';
import preferredLocaleKotlin from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_preferred_locale_2.kt?raw';
import preferredLocaleReactNative from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_preferred_locale_3.ts.txt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: preferredLocaleSwift, name: "iOS" },
    { type: "kotlin", content: preferredLocaleKotlin, name: "Android" },
    { type: "rn", content: preferredLocaleReactNative, name: "React Native" }
  ]}
/>


### Custom fonts

Using custom fonts in your paywall can now be done by uploading font files directly to RevenueCat. See the [Custom fonts](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#custom-fonts) section for more information.

#### Including custom fonts in your app

To improve the performance and reduce loading times of your paywall using custom fonts, you can add the font to your app's resources using the instructions below.

##### Android
To add a custom font to your Android app, place the font file in the `res/font` folder. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/text-and-emoji/fonts-in-xml) for more information.

##### iOS
To add a custom font to your iOS app, go to _File_ and then _Add Files to “Your Project Name”_. The font file should be a target member of your app, and be registered with iOS by adding the "Fonts provided by the application" key to your _Info.plist_ file. Make sure that the filename (without the extension) corresponds to the font name in the paywall editor. See [the official iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/adding-a-custom-font-to-your-app) for more information.

##### Kotlin Multiplatform, React Native, and Flutter
Adding custom fonts to a hybrid app involves adding the font files to the underlying Android and iOS projects following the instructions above.

### Intercepting an initiated purchase

You can intercept a purchase flow before it begins by using the `onPurchaseInitiated` view modifier in iOS and the `onPurchasePackageInitiated` method on the `PaywallListener` interface in Android. This allows you to perform custom logic, such as showing additional information to the user or performing validation checks, before the purchase proceeds.

When a user initiates a purchase, your interceptor callback will be invoked with:
- The `Package` that the user selected
- A `ResumeAction` closure that you must call to either proceed with or cancel the purchase

The purchase flow will pause until you call the `resume` action. If you call `resume(false)`, the purchase will be cancelled. If you call `resume(true)`, the purchase will proceed as normal.

:::info Availability
This feature is currently available on the native iOS and Android SDKs.
:::

import onPurchaseInitiatedSwift from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_on_purchase_initiated_1.swift?raw';
import onPurchaseInitiatedKotlin from '@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_on_purchase_initiated_1.kt?raw';

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: onPurchaseInitiatedSwift, name: "iOS" },
    { type: "kotlin", content: onPurchaseInitiatedKotlin, name: "Android" }
  ]}
/>

### Exit offers

Exit offers allow you to present an alternative offer when a user dismisses your paywall without making a purchase. This is a powerful tool for recovering potentially lost conversions by giving users a second chance to subscribe with a different offer, such as a discounted price or alternative package.

When a user tries to close or navigate back from the paywall, instead of immediately dismissing, a secondary paywall will be displayed with the exit offer.

#### How it works

1. User attempts to dismiss the main paywall without purchasing
2. An exit offer paywall is automatically presented with an alternative offering
3. The user can either:
   - Subscribe to the exit offer
   - Dismiss the exit offer, which then dismisses the main paywall

#### Configuration

Exit offers are configured entirely in the [Paywalls editor](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls#configuring-exit-offers) in the RevenueCat dashboard. No code changes are required to use this feature. Once configured, the exit offer will automatically be presented when users attempt to dismiss the paywall, as long as you're using a supported presentation method.

#### Supported presentation methods

Exit offers only work when using the `presentPaywall` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded` functions that display paywalls in iOS and cross platform SDKs. In Android, they work automatically when using the `PaywallDialog` and `PaywallActivity` classes.

:::warning View-based APIs not supported
Exit offers will **not** work if you manually embed paywall views/components in your UI (e.g., `PaywallView`, `Paywall` composable, `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>` component, etc).

## Changes from legacy Paywalls

### Footer Paywalls

Our current Paywalls no longer support footer Paywalls. If your app requests the Paywall for an Offering to display that has a current Paywall, it will display a default version of that paywall instead (see [Default Paywall](#default-paywall)). Footer mode can still be used on legacy Paywalls templates using the existing method, or the new `.originalTemplatePaywallFooter()` method on SDK versions that support our current Paywalls.

### Close buttons

Our current Paywalls do not require the `displayCloseButton` parameter (or equivalent for other platforms), and it will have no effect if used, since close buttons can be optionally added directly to your paywall as a component if desired.

### Font provider

Our current Paywalls do not support passing in a custom font provider as legacy Paywalls did. Instead, you can now configure Paywalls to use the fonts you've already installed in your app directly from the Dashboard. Using the original handler will have no effect on current Paywalls.
