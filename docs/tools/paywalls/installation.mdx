2. Double-click and make sure version is at least `4.26.0`:

![Configure version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/f537a1e1-a1ab-4e6f-986c-05abdcf1dd9f)

3. Open your target settings and find "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content":

![Find frameworks in your target](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/af078e9a-4b98-42c6-8ca7-6f79aebdf3e0)

### Using CocoaPods:

Add the following to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'RevenueCat'
pod 'RevenueCatUI'
```

## Native Android Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-android.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases)

1. Add `RevenueCatUI`:
```groovy build.gradle
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:<latest version>'
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui:<latest version>'
```

## React Native Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/releases)

- Update your `package.json` to include `react-native-purchases-ui`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-purchases": "<latest version>",
    "react-native-purchases-ui": "<latest version>"
  }
}
```

## Flutter Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-flutter/releases)

- Add `purchases-ui-flutter` in your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  purchases_flutter: <latest version>
  purchases_ui_flutter: <latest version>
```
- For Android, you need to change your `MainActivity` to subclass `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`.

import flutterMainActivity from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/getting-started/installation/flutter_mainactivity.dart";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      type: "MainActivity.kt",
      content: flutterMainActivity,
      name: "MainActivity.kt",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Kotlin Multiplatform Installation

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RevenueCat/purchases-kmp.svg?filter=!*beta*&style=flat)](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-kmp/releases)

Add the following Maven coordinates to your `libs.versions.toml`:
```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions] 
purchases-kmp = "<latest version>"

[libraries]
purchases-core = { module = "com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-core", version.ref = "purchases-kmp" }
purchases-ui = { module = "com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-ui", version.ref = "purchases-kmp" }
```

Then add the dependencies to the `commonMain` sourceset in your Compose Multiplatform module's `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    // ...
    sourceSets {
        // ...
        commonMain.dependencies {  
            // Add the purchases-kmp dependencies.
            implementation(libs.purchases.core)  
            implementation(libs.purchases.ui)  
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, you'll need to make sure you link the `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` native iOS framework. If your iOS app uses Swift Package Manager, add the `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` library to your target in the same way you added the `PurchasesHybridCommon` library. If your iOS app uses CocoaPods, either update its `Podfile`, or update your Compose Multiplatform module's `build.gradle.kts`, depending on how your Multiplatform module is integrated with your iOS project.
