## Native iOS Installation

### Using SPM:

#### If you already have `RevenueCat` in your project:

1. Open your project settings and select "Package Dependencies":

![Change version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/d317fd33-8270-4d9b-9b38-8f5f14342b04)

2. Double-click and make sure version is at least `4.26.0`:

![Configure version](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/f537a1e1-a1ab-4e6f-986c-05abdcf1dd9f)

3. Open your target settings and find "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content":

![Find frameworks in your target](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/af078e9a-4b98-42c6-8ca7-6f79aebdf3e0)

4. Add `RevenueCatUI`:

![Add RevenueCatUI dependency](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/c2a3498c-b80d-405c-bdf6-75de927ea58e)

#### First time integrating the RevenueCat SDK:

1. Click File -> Add Packages...

2. Search for `git@github.com:RevenueCat/purchases-ios.git` and make sure version is at least `4.26.0`:

![Adding purchases-ios dependency](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-ios/assets/685609/18291043-5710-4944-ba12-7d6d83bde240)

3. Add `RevenueCat` and `RevenueCatUI` SPM dependency to your project:

![Add paywall](/images/9140485-Screenshot_2023-08-04_at_12.08.07_78343500e565bc1fd0fceaac72486876.png)

### Using CocoaPods:

Add the following to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'RevenueCat'
pod 'RevenueCatUI'
```

## Native Android Installation

1. Add `RevenueCatUI`:
```groovy build.gradle
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:7.1.0'
implementation 'com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-ui:7.1.0'
```

:::danger
Android paywalls is currently behind an experimental flag (`ExperimentalPreviewRevenueCatUIPurchasesAPI`).

It is safe to release app updates with it. We guarantee that paywalls will continue to work and any changes will always be backwards compatible.

They are stable, but migration steps may be required in the future. We'll do our best to minimize any changes you have to make.

## React Native Installation

- Update your `package.json` to include `react-native-purchases-ui`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-purchases": "7.15.0",
    "react-native-purchases-ui": "7.15.0"
  }
}
```

## Flutter Installation

- Add `purchases-ui-flutter` in your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  purchases_flutter: 6.15.0
  purchases_ui_flutter: 6.15.0
```
- For Android, you need to change your `MainActivity` to subclass `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`.

## Kotlin Multiplatform Installation

Add the following Maven coordinates to your `libs.versions.toml`:
```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions] 
purchases-kmp = "1.1.0+13.3.0"

[libraries]
purchases-core = { module = "com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-core", version.ref = "purchases-kmp" }
purchases-ui = { module = "com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases-kmp-ui", version.ref = "purchases-kmp" }
```

Then add the dependencies to the `commonMain` sourceset in your Compose Multiplatform module's `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
    // ...
    sourceSets {
        // ...
        commonMain.dependencies {  
            // Add the purchases-kmp dependencies.
            implementation(libs.purchases.core)  
            implementation(libs.purchases.ui)  
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, you'll need to make sure you link the `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` native iOS framework. If your iOS app uses Swift Package Manager, add the `PurchasesHybridCommonUI` library to your target in the same way you added the `PurchasesHybridCommon` library. If your iOS app uses CocoaPods, either update its `Podfile`, or update your Compose Multiplatform module's `build.gradle.kts`, depending on how your Multiplatform module is integrated with your iOS project.
