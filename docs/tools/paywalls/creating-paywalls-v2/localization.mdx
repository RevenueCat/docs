# Localization

Paywall localization can be managed in line through the Paywall Editor, or through the Paywall Localization page.

## Editing in line

## Editing via the Paywall Localization page

To access the Paywall Localization page:

1. Click `English (United States)` in the control panel (or whichever locale is present if you've already configured another locale)
2. Then click `Manage localization...`

From here, you'll see a table with each locale you've setup for your paywall. To add a new locale, click `+ Add locale`.

After adding your new locale, you'll have a few options for how to fill in values for it.

First, you can click `Paste default value` to take the value for that field from the default locale and paste it in the new locale.

Or, alternatively, if you're editing many locales at once, you can click `Push value to all locales` from a field that has already been configured to have that value set for the field in all other locales at once.

These options are especially useful if you're using variables in the field being modified, since they can remain consistent across all localizations.

In addition, if you want to change the default locale that's used in the Paywall Editor, and that your paywall will fall back to if a customer's desired locale is unavailable, you can do so by clicking on the settings icon in the header row of the locale you'd like to make default, and then clicking `Set as default`.

Be sure to enter values for all fields in each locale you create in order to be able to publish the changes to your Paywall.

:::info Import/export localization CSV
We expect to have support for exporting a CSV of paywall fields & locales, and re-importing that CSV with filled in values in the near future to make this process even easier.
