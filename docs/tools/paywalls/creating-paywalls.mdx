## Key concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Components           | RevenueCat's predefined UI elements that can be added to a paywall. (e.g. text, an image, a purchase button, etc.)                |
| Component properties | The properties of each component that can be configured to modify it's style and behavior. (e.g. its width, height, border, etc.) |
| Templates            | The paywalls that RevenueCat has already created that you can use as a starting point to build your own paywall from.             |

## Components

Components are the individual building blocks of your paywall that can be arranged and configured to create your own custom layout.

| Component       | Description                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text            | Used to add customizable text strings                                                      |
| Image           | Used to add an uploaded image                                                              |

| Carousel        | Used to add a carousel of pages that a customer can swipe through                         |
| Timeline        | Used to add a timeline of connected items                     |
| Package         | Used to add a selectable package with custom styling, text, etc.                           |
| Purchase button | The call to action that invokes a purchase attempt of the selected package.                |
| Button          | Used to add other interactions; such as a link to your Privacy Policy, a back button, etc. |
| Footer          | A configurable portion of your paywall whose position is fixed and uniquely styled.        |

:::info Parent components
Stacks, packages, buttons, and the footer are all parents components which can contain other child components within them to be jointly controlled.

## Building paywalls

To get started building paywalls with our new editor, click on **+ New Paywall** in the callout on the Paywalls page for your Project:

![Create new paywall](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-create-new-paywall.png)

Next, you'll need to select the Offering you want to add a Paywall to. Or, if you don't have any Offerings without Paywalls, you'll have the option to duplicate an existing one or create a new one.

From there, you can start building by either:

1. Choosing a template, or
2. Starting from scratch

Unless you have a very specific, custom design in mind that you're looking to create; **we recommend starting with a template.** You can customize any aspect of your paywall once you select a template, it's simply a starting point to explore from.

![Select a template](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-select-template.png)

### Using the editor

Once you've selected a template or picked starting from scratch, you'll land on our Paywall Editor, which has the following sections:

1. **Components**: The list of components on your paywall, their hierarchy, and their options (rename, duplicate, etc).
2. **Component properties**: The list of configurable properties of the component you've selected.
3. **Preview**: The preview of your paywall.
4. **Control panel**: The options to change the locale, light/dark mode, and other preview settings to see how your paywall looks in various scenarios. The control panel is also where you can manage localizations through one page instead of modifying them component-by-component.

![Paywalls editor](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-editor.png)

### Adding components

Components can be added to a paywall in two ways:

1. Directly to the main paywall with the **+ Add Component** button
2. Directly within a parent component, such as a stack, with the **+** button in that component's row in the components panel.

Once a component has been added to a paywall, you can determine its order on your paywall by dragging it vertically in the stack, or determine its parent component by dragging it underneath the desired parent and indenting it horizontally.

![Arrange components](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-arrange-components.gif)

:::tip Parent & child components
A child component will be subject to the axis, alignment, distribution, and child spacing properties of the parent component; and will be impacted by other properties such as margin & padding.
:::

### Modifying components

When you click on a component in the components panel, you'll see it displayed in the component properties panel on the right side of your screen. These properties represent the configurable elements of each component that can be used to give it a unique look and feel.

Many properties for controlling layout, size, and appearance are similar between components; but each one has their own unique properties that are specific to the use cases of that component.

![Stack properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-properties.png)

In addition, by clicking on the **...** option in a component's row in the components panel, you can rename, duplicate, or delete any component.

![Stack options](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-options.png)

:::info Editor shortcuts
You can use common keyboard shortcuts to undo, redo, and save your changes in the editor.

- Undo: `⌘ + z` on Mac, or `Ctrl + z` on Windows
- Redo: `⌘ + y` on Mac, or `Ctrl + y` on Windows  
- Save: `⌘ + s` on Mac, or `Ctrl + s` on Windows

### Saving a paywall

When saving a paywall, there are two different states it can be saved in depending on what you're ready to do with it.

| Paywall State | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inactive      | Paywalls that you do not wish to serve to customers. You can think of these as drafts, or works in progress. Inactive Paywalls will not be available through the SDK.                                                                                                                     |
| Published     | Paywalls that you may wish to serve to customers. These will always be returned on supported SDK versions. Whether they will be served to customers depends on whether you've configured the associated Offering as the Default Offering, or are serving it via Targeting or Experiments. |

When creating a new paywall, you can save your changes at any time by clicking the **Save to draft** button at the top right of the page.

This will save your paywall in an inactive state so that you can continue editing it, but it will not yet be sent to your app and made available to customers.

To make your paywall available to customers, click **Publish Paywall**. Once a paywall is published, it will be available via the RevenueCat SDK and therefore can be seen by your customers depending on how you're serving Offerings to them.

You can also set a published paywall to be inactive, or vice versa, at any time.

### Safe area preview

The paywall preview in the dashboard includes a preview of the device safe area that will impact how your paywall is rendered. RevenueCat Paywalls will automatically handle the device safe area for you when displaying paywalls on device, but there are a few things you should keep in mind:
1. All components will **not** occupy the safe area at the top of the device **unless they are being used as header images**, which do occupy the space. We automatically detect an image component as a header image if it's the first component taking up vertical space on the paywall (e.g. the first component in the list, or the first component in a stack) whose width is set to fill the entire width of the paywall. If the image is being used within a z stack, any other components above it will not occupy the safe area.
2. The footer component will **not** occupy the bottom safe area, and will automatically add applicable padding to account for it on each platform and device.
3. Paywalls which do not use a footer component will occupy the bottom safe area if the content extends that far, as any other view would.

If your paywall will be displayed in a sheet view instead of a full screen view, you can also preview that view in the paywall editor. Just click on **Preview settings** and select **Sheet view**.

:::info Preview added in May 2025
The safe area preview was added to the dashboard in May 2025 to more accurately reflect how paywalls will be displayed on device. If your paywall now has more top/bottom margin/padding than desired, you can adjust it to ensure the look more closely matches your intended design.

**The new safe area preview has no effect on how paywalls are displayed on device, as the SDK has always handled rendering around the safe area.**
