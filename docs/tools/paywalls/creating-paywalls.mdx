## Building paywalls

To get started building paywalls with our new editor, click on **+ New Paywall** in the callout on the Paywalls page for your Project:

![Create new paywall](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-create-new-paywall.png)

Next, you'll need to select the Offering you want to add a Paywall to. Or, if you don't have any Offerings without Paywalls, you'll have the option to duplicate an existing one or create a new one.

From there, you can start building by either:

1. Choosing a template
2. Starting from scratch, or
3. Importing from Figma

Unless you have a very specific, custom design in mind that you're looking to create; **we recommend starting with a template.** You can customize any aspect of your paywall once you select a template, it's simply a starting point to explore from.

![Select a template](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-select-template.png)

### Using the editor

Once you've imported from Figma, selected a template, or picked starting from scratch, you'll land on our Paywall Editor, which has the following sections:

1. **Components**: The list of components on your paywall, their hierarchy, and their options (rename, duplicate, etc).
2. **Component properties**: The list of configurable properties of the component you've selected.
3. **Preview**: The preview of your paywall.
4. **Control panel**: The options to change the locale, light/dark mode, and other preview settings to see how your paywall looks in various scenarios. The control panel is also where you can manage localizations through one page instead of modifying them component-by-component.

![Paywalls editor](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-editor.png)

### Adding components

Components can be added to a paywall in two ways:

1. Directly to the main paywall with the **+ Add Component** button
2. Directly within a parent component, such as a stack, with the **+** button in that component's row in the components panel.

Once a component has been added to a paywall, you can determine its order on your paywall by dragging it vertically in the stack, or determine its parent component by dragging it underneath the desired parent and indenting it horizontally.

![Arrange components](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-arrange-components.gif)

:::tip Parent & child components
A child component will be subject to the axis, alignment, distribution, and child spacing properties of the parent component; and will be impacted by other properties such as margin & padding.
:::

### Modifying components

When you click on a component in the components panel, you'll see it displayed in the component properties panel on the right side of your screen. These properties represent the configurable elements of each component that can be used to give it a unique look and feel.

Many properties for controlling layout, size, and appearance are similar between components; but each one has their own unique properties that are specific to the use cases of that component.

[Learn more about component properties.](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/component-properties)

![Stack properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-properties.png)

In addition, by clicking on the **...** option in a component's row in the components panel, you can rename, duplicate, or delete any component.

![Stack options](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-options.png)

:::info Editor shortcuts
You can use common keyboard shortcuts to undo, redo, and save your changes in the editor.

- Undo: `⌘ + z` on Mac, or `Ctrl + z` on Windows
- Redo: `⌘ + y` on Mac, or `Ctrl + y` on Windows  
- Save: `⌘ + s` on Mac, or `Ctrl + s` on Windows

### Saving a paywall

When saving a paywall, there are two different states it can be saved in depending on what you're ready to do with it.

| Paywall State | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inactive      | Paywalls that you do not wish to serve to customers. You can think of these as drafts, or works in progress. Inactive Paywalls will not be available through the SDK.                                                                                                                     |
| Published     | Paywalls that you may wish to serve to customers. These will always be returned on supported SDK versions. Whether they will be served to customers depends on whether you've configured the associated Offering as the Default Offering, or are serving it via Targeting or Experiments. |

When creating a new paywall, you can save your changes at any time by clicking the **Save to draft** button at the top right of the page.

This will save your paywall in an inactive state so that you can continue editing it, but it will not yet be sent to your app and made available to customers.

To make your paywall available to customers, click **Publish Paywall**. Once a paywall is published, it will be available via the RevenueCat SDK and therefore can be seen by your customers depending on how you're serving Offerings to them.

You can also set a published paywall to be inactive, or vice versa, at any time.

### Importing from Figma

![Figma plugin](/docs_images/paywalls/figma_to_rc.png)

The [RevenueCat plugin in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1571207414894772119/revenuecat) allows you to import paywall designs from Figma into RevenueCat. It's ideal for teams that have dedicated designers working in Figma. It allows designers to create pixel-perfect paywall designs in Figma that can then be seamlessly brought into RevenueCat, reducing the need for manual recreation and ensuring design consistency.

**To import a paywall from Figma:**

1. **Install the RevenueCat plugin** in Figma:
   - Open Figma and navigate to the [RevenueCat plugin page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1571207414894772119/revenuecat)
   - Click **Install** to add the plugin to your Figma workspace

2. **Design your paywall** in Figma:
   - Create **one top-level Frame per paywall** you want to import.
   - Use **Auto layout** for layout Frames so spacing/alignment import cleanly.
   - Only a few layers need special names (like `Button(...)` or `Carousel(...)`). Everything else can be named however you like.
   - Any layers hidden in Figma (visibility off) are skipped during import.

   :::warning Figma auto layout required
   Your paywall designs must be using Figma auto layout to be imported correctly.
   :::

3. **Export to RevenueCat**:
   - Prepare your frames (use auto layout, check the naming conventions below)
   - Create an API V2 key in your RevenueCat project with `Read & write` in Project configuration permissions
   - Open the RevenueCat plugin from your Figma plugins menu
   - Authenticate with your RevenueCat account using the API key you created in the previous step
   - Select the frames you want to export (each frame will be created as its own paywall in RevenueCat)
   - Choose the project and offering where you want to import the paywall
   - Click **Export** to add your paywall design in RevenueCat

4. **Refine in the Paywall Editor**:
   - Once imported, click the link for your paywall in the plugin to open it in the Paywall Editor
   - Finish setup (for example: select which RevenueCat packages your `Package` components represent, configure button destinations, and add localizations)

5. **Publish and deploy**:
   - After making any final adjustments, save and publish your paywall
   - The paywall will be available through the RevenueCat SDK and can be served to your customers

#### Frame naming conventions

Most layers import based on what they are in Figma:

- **Text layers** become **Text** components automatically
- **Shapes/layers with an image fill** become **Image** components automatically
- **Frames** become **Stack** components automatically (Auto layout direction, spacing, and padding are used)

To create certain **special RevenueCat components**, name the layer using one of these patterns:

- `ComponentName` (example: `Footer`)
- `ComponentName(value)` (example: `Icon(star)`)
- `ComponentName(param=value, flag=true)` (example: `Carousel(loop=true, auto_advance=true)`)

Use the **exact spelling/capitalization/spacing** shown below (for example `Purchase Button` includes a space).

#### RevenueCat component support

The table below shows which RevenueCat paywall components can be imported from Figma. The "Figma Frame Name" column shows what to name your frame in Figma to create that component.

| Status | RevenueCat Component | Figma Frame Name |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| ✅ | **Button** | `Button` or `Button(action=action_type)` — [See button actions](#button-actions) |
| ✅ | **Carousel** | `Carousel` — [See carousel structure](#carousel-structure) |
| ✅ | **Footer** | `Footer` - note: You can only have **one** `Footer` per paywall frame |
| ✅ | **Icon** | `Icon(icon-name)` — e.g., `Icon(star)` or `Icon(check-circle)` |
| ✅ | **Image** | Automatic — any shape with an image fill |
| ✅ | **Package** | `Package` — [See package with selected state](#package-with-selected-state) |
| ✅ | **Purchase Button** | `Purchase Button` |
| ✅ | **Stack** | Automatic — any frame with auto layout and children |
| ✅ | **Tabs** | `Tabs` — [See tabs structure](#tabs-structure) |
| ✅ | **Text** | Automatic — any text layer |
| ✅ | **Video** | `Video`, or any shape with a video fill |
| ✅ | **Express checkout (express purchase button)** | `ExpressPurchaseButton` — [See express checkout structure](#express-checkout-structure) / [Web Paywalls: Express checkout](/web/web-billing/paywalls#express-checkout) |
| ✅ | **Express checkout (wallet button)** | `WalletButton` — [Web Paywalls: Express checkout](/web/web-billing/paywalls#express-checkout) |
| ✅ | **Express checkout (skeleton loader)** | `Skeleton` — [Web Paywalls: Express checkout](/web/web-billing/paywalls#express-checkout) |
| ❌ | **Awards** | Not yet supported |
| ❌ | **Countdown** | Not yet supported |
| ❌ | **Feature list** | Not yet supported |
| ❌ | **Social proof** | Not yet supported |
| ❌ | **Switch** | Not yet supported |
| ❌ | **Timeline** | Not yet supported |

#### Button actions

When naming a Button frame, you can specify what action it performs:

| Figma Frame Name | Action |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| `Button` | If the button contains text starting with "Restore", it will restore purchases. Otherwise, it navigates back. |
| `Button(action=restore_purchases)` | Restores previous purchases |
| `Button(action=navigate_back)` | Closes the paywall |
| `Button(action=navigate_to)` | Navigates to a URL (configure the destination/URL in RevenueCat after import) |
| `Button(action=workflow)` | Triggers a workflow (configure the workflow in RevenueCat after import) |

If you specify an invalid action type, it will default to `navigate_back`.

#### Carousel structure

To create a Carousel, your Figma frame structure should look like this:

```text
Carousel
├── Pages
│   ├── Page 1 (any frame name)
│   ├── Page 2 (any frame name)
│   └── Page 3 (any frame name)
└── Indicators (optional)
```

Notes:

- The Carousel looks specifically for a child named **`Pages`** (this is required).
- `Indicators` is optional. If present, it should contain two layers whose names include **“active”** and **“inactive”** (for example `Active` and `Inactive`) so the importer can pick up their styling.
- If `Indicators` appears above `Pages` in the layer list, the dots will be placed at the top; otherwise they’ll be placed at the bottom.

You can also add optional parameters: `Carousel(loop=true)` to enable infinite looping, or `Carousel(auto_advance=true)` to auto-scroll through pages.

#### Package with selected state

A Package component displays a subscription option that customers can select. To show different styling when a package is selected vs. unselected, you'll use Figma's **component variants** feature.

**Basic usage (no selected state):**

Simply name your frame `Package`. The same styling will be used whether the package is selected or not.

**With selected state styling:**

1. Create a **component set** in Figma (select your Package frame and use "Create component set")
2. Add a property called `State` with two variants:
   - `State=Default` — How the package looks when **not** selected
   - `State=Selected` — How the package looks when selected (e.g., different border color, background, checkmark visible)

Your Figma layers panel should look like this:

```text
Package (Component Set)
├── State=Default
│   └── (your package content)
└── State=Selected
    └── (your package content with selected styling)
```

When you place instances of this component in your paywall design, the importer will automatically detect both variants and create the appropriate selected state overrides in RevenueCat.

#### Tabs structure

A Tabs component lets customers switch between different views—commonly used to offer different subscription tiers (e.g., "Basic" vs. "Pro") or billing periods (e.g., "Monthly" vs. "Annual"). Tabs require Figma's **component variants** to define the content for each tab.

**How it works:**

1. The `TabButtons` frame contains the clickable tab buttons
2. Each tab button's content is defined as a separate **component variant**
3. When a customer taps a tab, RevenueCat shows the corresponding variant's content

**Step 1: Create your Tabs frame structure**

```text
Tabs
└── TabContent(monthly)
    ├── TabButtons
    │   ├── Tab(monthly)
    │   └── Tab(annual)
    └── (content for the monthly tab)
```

The `TabContent` frame should be a **component** with the default variant's identifier (e.g., `TabContent(monthly)` if "monthly" is the default tab).

**Step 2: Create component variants for each tab**

Convert your `TabContent` frame to a component, then create variants for each tab:

```text
TabContent (Component Set)
├── TabContent(monthly)
│   ├── TabButtons
│   │   ├── Tab(monthly)
│   │   └── Tab(annual)
│   └── (monthly pricing, features, etc.)
└── TabContent(annual)
    ├── TabButtons
    │   ├── Tab(monthly)
    │   └── Tab(annual)
    └── (annual pricing, features, etc.)
```

**Important:** The identifier in each `Tab(identifier)` must match a `TabContent(identifier)` variant (for example, `Tab(monthly)` must have a corresponding `TabContent(monthly)` variant). The `TabButtons` frame should appear in each variant so the tab buttons remain visible when switching tabs.

Additional rules:

- `TabButtons` must be **inside** `TabContent` (not directly under `Tabs`). It can be nested anywhere inside `TabContent`.
- The `Tab(identifier)` values must match the tab content you export (for example, if you have `Tab(monthly)`, you should also have a `TabContent(monthly)` variant available).

#### Express checkout structure

You can import the components that power the Express checkout quick purchase experience.

For details on how this behaves on the web, see [Web Paywalls: Express checkout](/web/web-billing/paywalls#express-checkout).

`ExpressPurchaseButton` must contain these three child frames:

```text
ExpressPurchaseButton
├── WalletAvailable
├── WalletUnavailable
└── WalletUnknown
```

Inside those frames you can use layout/content the same way you build the rest of your paywall (text, images, stacks, etc.). You can also use:

- `WalletButton` to place the Apple Pay / Google Pay button in the appropriate state
- `Skeleton` to show loading placeholders

:::

### Duplicating a paywall

If you want to use an existing paywall as a starting point for a new paywall, you can duplicate it by clicking on the three horizontal dots to the right of the paywall in the list and selecting either:
1. **Duplicate to this project** if you want to make a copy of that paywall within this same project
2. **Duplicate to another project** if you want to make a copy of that paywall within another project you own

:::info Create your own "templates"
If you'd like to create a few of your own paywall "templates" as your own starting points, simply duplicate the paywall you want to save as a template, and don't attach an Offering to it. It'll be available in the dashboard to edit or duplicate from at any time, without affecting what actually gets delivered to your app.
:::

:::warning Custom fonts
Unfortunately if you use custom fonts in your paywall, they will not be supported when duplicatiing **to another project**. Instead, those fonts will need to be uploaded to that project and manually set for the paywall. When duplicating within the same project, custom fonts settings will be preserved.
:::

![Duplicate](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-duplicate.png)

### Configuring exit offers

Exit offers allow you to present an alternative offer when a user dismisses your paywall without making a purchase. This can help recover potentially lost conversions by giving users a second chance to subscribe, with a different offer.

To configure an exit offer for your paywall:

1. Create a separate Offering with packages for your exit offer (e.g., a discounted package or alternative pricing), and create a paywall for it
2. In the Paywalls editor for your main paywall, configure the exit offer settings by selecting the exit offer offering to display

![Exit offer configuration](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-exit-offer-configuration.png)

Once configured, the exit offer will automatically be presented when users dismiss the paywall without purchasing. You must also use one of the supported presentation methods.
:::tip Best practices
When designing exit offers:
- Consider offering a discount or trial period that wasn't available in the main paywall
- Keep the exit offer paywall simple and focused on the value proposition
- Don't overuse exit offers. They should feel like a special opportunity, not an annoyance
:::

[Learn more about exit offers, supported presentation methods, and platform requirements.](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls#exit-offers)

### Safe area preview

The paywall preview in the dashboard includes a preview of the device safe area that will impact how your paywall is rendered. RevenueCat Paywalls will automatically handle the device safe area for you when displaying paywalls on device, but there are a few things you should keep in mind:
1. All components will **not** occupy the safe area at the top of the device **unless they are being used as header images**, which do occupy the space. We automatically detect an image component as a header image if it's the first component taking up vertical space on the paywall (e.g. the first component in the list, or the first component in a stack) whose width is set to fill the entire width of the paywall. If the image is being used within a z stack, any other components above it will not occupy the safe area.
2. The footer component will **not** occupy the bottom safe area, and will automatically add applicable padding to account for it on each platform and device.
3. Paywalls which do not use a footer component will occupy the bottom safe area if the content extends that far, as any other view would.

If your paywall will be displayed in a sheet view instead of a full screen view, you can also preview that view in the paywall editor. Just click on **Preview settings** and select **Sheet view**.

![Safe area preview](/docs_images/paywalls/safe-area-preview.png)
