## Building paywalls

To get started building paywalls with our new editor, click on **+ New Paywall** in the callout on the Paywalls page for your Project:

![Create new paywall](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-create-new-paywall.png)

Next, you'll need to select the Offering you want to add a Paywall to. Or, if you don't have any Offerings without Paywalls, you'll have the option to duplicate an existing one or create a new one.

From there, you can start building by either:

1. Choosing a template
2. Starting from scratch, or
3. [Importing from Figma](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/importing-from-figma)

Unless you have a very specific, custom design in mind that you're looking to create; **we recommend starting with a template.** You can customize any aspect of your paywall once you select a template, it's simply a starting point to explore from.

![Select a template](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-select-template.png)

### Using the editor

Once you've imported from Figma, selected a template, or picked starting from scratch, you'll land on our Paywall Editor, which has the following sections:

1. **Left-hand sidebar**: The tabs in the left-hand sidebar include:

    * **Add component:** List of components you can add to your paywall.
    * **Layers:** The list of components on your paywall, their hierarchy, and their options (rename, duplicate, etc).
    * **Branding:** Update your saved colors and fonts for quick access when building.
    * **Media gallery:** Where you can view and add images/videos.
    * **Localization:** Content of the Localizations used in your paywall as well as where you can add support for more languages.
    * **Paywall settings:** Where the overarching settings for your paywall live

2. **Preview**: The preview of your paywall.
3. **Control panel**: The options to change the locale, light/dark mode, and other preview settings to see how your paywall looks in various scenarios.

![Paywalls editor](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-editor.png)

### Adding components

Components can be added to a paywall in two ways:

1. Directly to the main paywall with the **+Add Component** tab in the left-hand sidebar
2. Directly within a parent component, such as a stack, with the **+** button in that component's row in the components panel.

Once a component has been added to a paywall, you can determine its order on your paywall by dragging it vertically in the stack, or determine its parent component by dragging it underneath the desired parent and indenting it horizontally.

![Arrange components](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-arrange-components.gif)

:::tip Parent & child components
A child component will be subject to the axis, alignment, distribution, and child spacing properties of the parent component; and will be impacted by other properties such as margin & padding.
:::

### Modifying components

When you click on a component in the components panel, you'll see it displayed in the component properties panel on the right side of your screen. These properties represent the configurable elements of each component that can be used to give it a unique look and feel.

Many properties for controlling layout, size, and appearance are similar between components; but each one has their own unique properties that are specific to the use cases of that component.

[Learn more about component properties.](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/component-properties)

![Stack properties](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-properties.png)

In addition, by clicking on the **...** option in a component's row in the components panel, you can rename, duplicate, or delete any component.

![Stack options](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-stack-options.png)

:::info Editor shortcuts
You can use common keyboard shortcuts to undo, redo, and save your changes in the editor.

- Undo: `⌘ + z` on Mac, or `Ctrl + z` on Windows
- Redo: `⌘ + y` on Mac, or `Ctrl + y` on Windows  
- Save: `⌘ + s` on Mac, or `Ctrl + s` on Windows

### Saving a paywall

When saving a paywall, there are two different states it can be saved in depending on what you're ready to do with it.

| Paywall State | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inactive      | Paywalls that you do not wish to serve to customers. You can think of these as drafts, or works in progress. Inactive Paywalls will not be available through the SDK.                                                                                                                     |
| Published     | Paywalls that you may wish to serve to customers. These will always be returned on supported SDK versions. Whether they will be served to customers depends on whether you've configured the associated Offering as the Default Offering, or are serving it via Targeting or Experiments. |

When creating a new paywall, you can save your changes at any time by clicking the **Save to draft** button at the top right of the page.

This will save your paywall in an inactive state so that you can continue editing it, but it will not yet be sent to your app and made available to customers.

To make your paywall available to customers, click **Publish Paywall**. Once a paywall is published, it will be available via the RevenueCat SDK and therefore can be seen by your customers depending on how you're serving Offerings to them.

You can also set a published paywall to be inactive, or vice versa, at any time.

### Importing from Figma

If you already have a design in Figma, use the RevenueCat Figma plugin to import your frames directly into the Paywall Editor. Follow the full import guide in [Importing from Figma](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/importing-from-figma).

### Duplicating a paywall

If you want to use an existing paywall as a starting point for a new paywall, you can duplicate it by clicking on the three horizontal dots to the right of the paywall in the list and selecting either:
1. **Duplicate to this project** if you want to make a copy of that paywall within this same project
2. **Duplicate to another project** if you want to make a copy of that paywall within another project you own

:::info Create your own "templates"
If you'd like to create a few of your own paywall "templates" as your own starting points, simply duplicate the paywall you want to save as a template, and don't attach an Offering to it. It'll be available in the dashboard to edit or duplicate from at any time, without affecting what actually gets delivered to your app.
:::

:::warning Custom fonts
Unfortunately if you use custom fonts in your paywall, they will not be supported when duplicatiing **to another project**. Instead, those fonts will need to be uploaded to that project and manually set for the paywall. When duplicating within the same project, custom fonts settings will be preserved.
:::

![Duplicate](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-duplicate.png)

### Configuring exit offers

Exit offers allow you to present an alternative offer when a user dismisses your paywall without making a purchase. This can help recover potentially lost conversions by giving users a second chance to subscribe, with a different offer.

To configure an exit offer for your paywall:

1. Create a separate Offering with packages for your exit offer (e.g., a discounted package or alternative pricing), and create a paywall for it
2. In the Paywalls editor for your main paywall, configure the exit offer settings by selecting the exit offer offering to display

![Exit offer configuration](/docs_images/paywalls/paywalls-exit-offer-configuration.png)

Once configured, the exit offer will automatically be presented when users dismiss the paywall without purchasing. You must also use one of the supported presentation methods.
:::tip Best practices
When designing exit offers:
- Consider offering a discount or trial period that wasn't available in the main paywall
- Keep the exit offer paywall simple and focused on the value proposition
- Don't overuse exit offers. They should feel like a special opportunity, not an annoyance
:::

[Learn more about exit offers, supported presentation methods, and platform requirements.](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls#exit-offers)

### Safe area preview

The paywall preview in the dashboard includes a preview of the device safe area that will impact how your paywall is rendered. RevenueCat Paywalls will automatically handle the device safe area for you when displaying paywalls on device, but there are a few things you should keep in mind:
1. All components will **not** occupy the safe area at the top of the device **unless they are being used as header images**, which do occupy the space. We automatically detect an image component as a header image if it's the first component taking up vertical space on the paywall (e.g. the first component in the list, or the first component in a stack) whose width is set to fill the entire width of the paywall. If the image is being used within a z stack, any other components above it will not occupy the safe area.
2. The footer component will **not** occupy the bottom safe area, and will automatically add applicable padding to account for it on each platform and device.
3. Paywalls which do not use a footer component will occupy the bottom safe area if the content extends that far, as any other view would.

If your paywall will be displayed in a sheet view instead of a full screen view, you can also preview that view in the paywall editor. Just click on **Preview settings** and select **Sheet view**.
