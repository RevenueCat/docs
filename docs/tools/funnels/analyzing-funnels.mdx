Funnel analytics provide insights into how customers interact with your funnel, where they drop off, and how effectively your funnel converts visitors into purchasers.

## Accessing funnel analytics

To view analytics for a funnel:

1. Navigate to your project's **Web** section
2. Click on the funnel you want to analyze
3. You'll see the details page of your funnel, which includes two analytics views:
   - **General metrics**: High-level overview of funnel performance
   - **Step-by-step metrics**: Conversion & drop-off for each step in your funnel

## General metrics

The General metrics view provides an overview of your funnel's overall performance with key metrics and trend charts.

### Key metrics

| Metric | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| **Unique viewers** | Total number of unique customers who viewed your funnel |
| **Initial conversion rate** | Percentage of viewers who completed a purchase or started a trial |
| **Revenue** | Revenue generated from initial funnel conversions |

These metrics are displayed as cards at the top of the analytics view and update based on your selected date range.

:::warning Unique viewers
Each time a funnel is opened without an App User ID, it will be counted as a unique viewer, as a new anonymous App User ID will be generated for that funnel session.
:::

### Conversion rate chart

The conversion rate chart shows how your funnel's conversion rate changes over time. This helps you:

- Identify trends in conversion performance
- Correlate changes with funnel updates or marketing campaigns
- Understand seasonal or temporal patterns

The chart displays conversion rate as a percentage, allowing you to see both the overall rate and how it fluctuates over your selected time period.

In addition, the volume of unique viewers in the period will be displayed as a column chart behind the conversion rate to easily understand how the volume of viewers may have influenced conversion.

### Revenue chart

The revenue chart tracks revenue generated by your funnel on the day that funnel was initially viewed (day 0) This helps you:

- Monitor initial revenue trends
- Correlate initial revenue with marketing spend or campaign performance

Revenue is displayed in the display currency set for your account.

:::info Renewal revenue
Support for revenue tracking for renewals and trial to paid conversions is coming in the near future, along with support for specifying the timeframe to measure revenue within.

### Metrics breakdown

The Metrics breakdown table provides a detailed view of your funnel's performance broken down by different segments (such as traffic sources, campaigns, or other attributes). This helps you understand which sources drive the most valuable traffic and conversions.

#### Table structure

The table displays metrics for each segment in separate rows, with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| **Source** | The segment value (e.g., traffic source name, campaign identifier) |
| **Unique Viewers** | Number of unique customers who viewed the funnel from this source |
| **Paywall Viewers** | Number of unique customers who viewed the paywall from this source |
| **Paywall View Rate** | Percentage of unique viewers who reached the paywall |
| **Initial Conversions** | Number of initial conversions (purchases or trial starts) from this source |
| **Initial Conversion Rate** | Percentage of unique viewers who converted from this source |
| **Revenue** | Revenue generated from conversions attributed to this source |

Rows are automatically sorted by the first metric (Unique Viewers) in descending order, so the highest-traffic sources appear at the top.

#### Customizing the breakdown

You can customize the Metrics breakdown table to focus on the data that matters most to you:

1. **Select a breakdown segment**: Click the settings button (⚙️) above the table to open the configuration panel. Choose which attribute you want to break down by (e.g., Campaign, Traffic Source, User Segment). The available segments depend on your funnel configuration and the data you're tracking.

2. **Show or hide metrics**: In the same settings panel, you can toggle which metrics are visible in the table. This allows you to focus on the metrics most relevant to your analysis.

3. **Save your preferences**: Your selected segment and visible metrics are saved automatically, they'll persist for all collaborators of your Project when you return to the funnel details page.

#### Understanding the data

- **Percentage metrics** (like Paywall View Rate and Initial Conversion Rate) are displayed as progress bars with the percentage value shown on the right. This visual representation makes it easy to compare performance across different sources at a glance.

- **Revenue** is displayed in your project's base currency and shows the total revenue generated from conversions attributed to each source during the selected date range.

- **Source identification**: The source column shows the segment value. For example, if breaking down by Campaign, you'll see campaign names or identifiers. If no segment value is available for a particular viewer, it may appear as "Unknown" or similar.

The Metrics breakdown table respects your selected date range and filters, so you can analyze performance for specific time periods or filtered subsets of your data.

## Step-by-step metrics

The Step-by-step metrics view provides detailed analytics for each step in your funnel, helping you identify where customers drop off and which steps are most effective.

### Metrics table

The step-by-step metrics table shows:

| Column | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| **Step name** | The name of the step (or "Unnamed step" if not named) |
| **Unique viewers** | Count of unique customers who viewed this step |
| **Conversions** | Count of unique viewers who completed this step (continuing on to the next one or completing a funnel) |
| **Step conversion rate** | Percentage of unique viewers who completed the step |
| **Drop-off** | Count of unique viewers who left the funnel at this step |
| **Step drop-off rate** | Percentage of unique viewers who left the funnel at this step |

### Understanding step metrics

#### Unique viewers

Unique viewers represent the number of unique customers who viewed this step. This includes:

- Customers who entered the funnel at this step (if it's the initial step)
- Customers who navigated to this step from a previous step

#### Conversions

Conversions represent the number of times customers successfully moved past this step. For screen steps, this means customers triggered an action that navigated to the next step. For checkout steps, this means customers completed a purchase.

#### Step conversion rate

Step conversion rate is calculated as:

```
Step Conversion Rate = (Conversions / Unique Viewers) × 100%
```

A high step conversion rate indicates the step is effective at moving customers forward. A low step conversion rate suggests customers are dropping off at this step.

#### Drop-off

Drop-off represents the number of unique viewers who left the funnel at this step without completing it.

#### Step drop-off rate

Step drop-off rate is the inverse of step conversion rate:

```
Step Drop-off Rate = 100% - Step Conversion Rate
```

This metric helps you quickly identify problem areas in your funnel.

:::info Should I focus on drop-off or conversion?
When analyzing your funnel, step conversion rate & absolute drop-off are the two metrics worth focusing on first. Step conversion rate shows you which steps are relatively ineffective at converting viewers forward, which indicates some kind of friction or misalignment in the step that might be addressable, but absolute drop-off tells you which of those steps have the highest potential impact to your overall conversion. For example, a step with a 10% conversion rate that has a very low volume of viewers on it may not actually be a great candidate for optimization, because it's not actually driving a high number of your overall drop-offs.

## Date range and filters

Both analytics views support date range selection and filtering:

### Date range

Select a date range to analyze performance over a specific period, either using our preset ranges or a custom range of your choosing.

For the breakdown and step-by-step tables, performance will be aggregated over the entire date range you select for analysis.

### Filters

Use filters to narrow down your data by dimensions such as country, platform, or attribution data.

:::Attribution data source
Attribution fields are derived from the UTM parameters you've attached to your funnel URLs.

## Limitations

Current analytics provide:

- ✅ Overall funnel metrics (unique viewers, conversions, revenue)
- ✅ Step-by-step conversion rates
- ✅ Time-based trends
- ✅ Metrics breakdown by segment (traffic sources, campaigns, etc.)
- ✅ Basic filtering

Coming soon:
