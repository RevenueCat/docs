Some Paywall components such as [Countdown](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#countdown) and [Video](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#video-component) have minimum SDK version requirements.

If you publish a paywall that includes components not supported by a customer’s SDK version, the paywall will fail to render for those customers, getting [RevenueCat's default paywall](/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls#default-paywall) instead of your intended design.

To customize what paywall older SDK customers get, you can implement a fallback paywall by creating a separate paywall and using Targeting to serve it only to them.

## When to use a fallback paywall

In many cases, you can handle SDK compatibility within a single paywall (for example, Countdown has a built-in [Fallback Stack](/tools/paywalls/creating-paywalls/components#fallback-stack) that allows you to customize what is displayed when the component is not supported).

However, a separate fallback paywall is a good fit when:

- You want to remove multiple unsupported components (or significantly simplify the layout).
- You want a different paywall structure or messaging for older app versions.
- You want to keep your “modern” paywall design clean without extra component-level fallbacks.

## How to create and serve a fallback paywall (recommended)

The overall workflow is:

1. Duplicate your paywall (this will also duplicate the associated Offering)
2. Remove unsupported components from the duplicated paywall
3. Create a Targeting Rule that serves the fallback Offering to older SDK versions

## 1. Duplicate your paywall (and Offering)

Start by duplicating the paywall you’re currently serving to customers.

1. Navigate to **Paywalls** in the RevenueCat Dashboard.
2. Find the paywall you want to use as the “primary” paywall.
3. Click the **⋯** menu, then select **Duplicate to this project**.

When you duplicate a paywall that’s attached to an Offering, RevenueCat will also create a **new Offering copy** for the duplicate. This lets you modify the fallback paywall (and its packages/metadata) without impacting what newer SDK versions see.

::::tip Naming convention
Give the duplicate a clear suffix for both display name and identifier like `-fallback` or `-legacy` (for example, `onboarding_v3_fallback`) so it’s obvious which paywall/Offering is intended for older SDK versions.
::::

## 2. Remove unsupported components from the fallback paywall

Open the duplicated paywall in the Paywall Editor and remove or replace anything that isn’t supported by your older SDK versions.

Common approaches:

- Replace a **Video** background with an **Image**
- Replace a **Countdown** with static text (or a simpler “limited-time” message)
- Simplify complex layouts (carousels, nested stacks, etc.) if needed

Then **publish** the fallback paywall once it’s ready to serve.

::::warning Keep the fallback paywall purchase-ready
Make sure the fallback paywall still includes everything required to convert (packages, a purchase button, and any required legal links).
::::

## 3. Create a Targeting Rule for older SDK versions

Now you’ll tell RevenueCat to serve the fallback Offering only when a customer is on an older SDK version.

1. Navigate to **Targeting** under **Monetization tools**.
2. Click **Create a new rule**.
3. Click **+ Add condition**, then choose **RevenueCat SDK Version**.
4. Select the SDK flavor you want to target (for example, `purchases-ios`, `purchases-android`, `react-native-purchases`, etc.).
5. Choose an operator like **less than** and enter the version number that represents the minimum SDK version that supports your primary paywall.
6. Select the **fallback Offering** (the one created by duplicating the paywall).
7. Set the rule to **Live** and click **Save**.

That’s it: customers on SDK versions **below** your threshold will receive the fallback Offering (and therefore the fallback paywall), while newer SDK versions will continue to receive your primary Offering based on your other rules and/or Default Offering.

::::tip Rule ordering matters
Targeting Rules are evaluated from top to bottom. Keep your “older SDK → fallback Offering” rule **above** any broader rules (like “Any audience”) so customers using older SDK versions don’t get matched by a more general rule first.
::::

## Notes for multi-platform apps

If your Project includes multiple apps/SDK flavors (for example iOS and Android), you’ll typically create **one fallback rule per SDK flavor**, since **RevenueCat SDK Version** conditions apply to a specific SDK.

If you also use Placements, you can still use this pattern — just make sure the fallback Offering is selected for the relevant Placement(s) for older SDK versions.
