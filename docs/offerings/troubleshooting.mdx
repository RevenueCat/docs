A common issue after configuring your products in the RevenueCat dashboard is that the products aren't able to be retrieved from the SDK. Typically, this is due to a configuration issue.

Here's how it works under the hood:

- Products are configured in the RevenueCat dashboard.
- The SDK retrieves the product identifiers from the RevenueCat API.
- The SDK uses that response to retrieve the products from the store on the device.

Since the actual products that your users purchase can only be retrieved from the stores directly on the device, any inconsistencies in the configuration between RevenueCat and the stores will prevent the products from being retrieved for purchase.
