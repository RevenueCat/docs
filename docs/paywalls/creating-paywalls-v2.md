| Components           | RevenueCat's predefined UI elements that can be added to a paywall.                                                              |
| Component properties | The properties of each component that can be configured to modify it's style and behavior (e.g. its width, height, border, etc). |
| Templates            | The paywalls that RevenueCat has already created that you can use as a starting point to build your own paywall from.            |

## Available components

Components are the individual building blocks of your paywall that can be arranged and configured to create your own custom layout.

## Getting started

You can start creating your paywall by either:

1. Choosing a template, or
2. Starting from scratch

Unless you have a very specific, custom design in mind that you're looking to create; **we recommend starting with a template.** You can customize any aspect of your paywall once select a template, it's simply a starting point to explore from.

### Using the editor

Once you've selected a template or picked starting from scratch, you'll land on our Paywall Editor, which has the following sections:

1. **Layers**: The list of components on your paywall, their hierarchy, and their options (rename, duplicate, etc).
2. **Component properties**: The list of configurable properties of the component you've selected.
3. **Preview**: The preview of your paywall.
4. **Control panel**: The options to change the locale, light/dark mode, and other preview settings to see how your paywall looks in various scenarios. The control panel is also where you can manage localizations through one page instead of modifying them component-by-component.

### Arranging components

Components can be added to a paywall in two ways:

1. Directly to the main paywall with the **+ Add Component** button
2. Directly within a complex component, such as a stack, with the **+** button in that component's row in the layers panel.

Once a component has been added to a paywall, you can determine its order by dragging it vertically in the stack, or determine its parent component by dragging it underneath the desired parent and indenting it horizontally.

:::tip Parent & child components
A child component will be subject to the axis, alignment, distribution, and child spacing properties of the parent component; and will be impacted by other properties such as margin & padding.
