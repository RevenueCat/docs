RevenueCat Customer Lists allow you to cohort and export groups of customers based on some interactions with your app and/or purchase behavior.

Lists are a segment of your customers inside RevenueCat, this can include both paying and non-paying users. Some lists are created automatically for every project (see Default lists below) and you can also create custom lists with your own defined filter logic.

:::info Sandbox Customers
The Customers dashboard tab doesn't support toggling the 'View sandbox data' switch as there is no concept of a sandbox customer in RevenueCat, only sandbox transactions.

To view customers who have made sandbox transactions you can use the default Sandbox list or apply the 'Made Sandbox Purchase' filter to a list.
:::

## Find an Individual Customer

You can look up an individual customer by an exact match of their App User ID, Transaction ID, Email Attribute, or Order ID (iOS only). To find a customer via Order ID, you can follow our guide on setting up [In-App Purchase Keys](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration) to unlock this feature. The transaction must show as completed in the [Apple Purchase History](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204088) to be considered a valid Order ID. Note that Transaction ID refers to the identifier in Google Play console and order emails of GPA.1234.1223â€“, and for Stripe si_abcefg, whereas Order ID refers to the identifier from Apple's order emails.

:::warning Sandbox transaction search
Customer lookup by Transaction ID and Order ID works for production purchases only.
:::

Looking up customers in RevenueCat is real-time, as soon as a customer exists in RevenueCat they will be searchable here.

## Viewing a List

![Choose a project](/docs_images/customers/choose-project.png)

### Default lists

![Default lists](/docs_images/customers/default-lists.png)

RevenueCat creates some default lists for every project. Default lists should give you insight into every customer that has ever made any purchase.

| Default List        | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active subscription | Any customer with an active subscription or trial.                               |
| Sandbox             | Any customer who has any sandbox transaction associated with their App User ID.  |
| Non-subscription    | Any customer with a non-subscription purchase associated with their App User ID. |
| Expired             | Any customer with an expired subscription or trial.                              |

:::info Granted Entitlements are not considered 'Active'

If a customer has a [Granted Entitlement](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history/promotionals) transaction, they are not considered as 'Active'. Note that if a customer has an active subscription + Granted Entitlement, they will not be counted in the Active Customer List.

:::

### Custom lists

In addition to Default Lists, you can create new Custom Lists with any combination of `AND` filters. See the section below on 'Filters' for a full description of available filters.

![Custom lists](/docs_images/customers/custom-lists.png)

:::info Custom lists are shared across collaborators
Any custom lists you create will also be visible to any project collaborators with Read or Admin privileges.

## Overview Metrics

For each list, RevenueCat computes overview metrics for the cohort of customers.

![Aggregate metrics](/docs_images/customers/aggregate-metrics.png)

:::info Active Subscribers vs. Active Subscriptions
Active "subscribers" may be lower than your count of all active "subscriptions" (e.g. in Overview or Charts) if some customers have multiple active subscriptions.
:::

## List Data

For each list, RevenueCat displays the 100 most recently seen customers in the dashboard.

![Customers table](/docs_images/customers/customers-table.png)

The dashboard shows the App User ID, purchase status, total spent (USD) and the latest product identifier purchased. Additional columns are available when exporting data.

:::info Data freshness
Customer lists are refreshed every 2 hours automatically
:::

## Filters

Filters allow you to choose which customers appear in your list. You can create custom lists with any combination of filters. **All filters are applied as AND filters**.

![Customer list filters](/docs_images/customers/customer_list_filters.png)

:::info Duplicating a Customer List
If you would like to create another version of a List with further filters, you can open the filters menu and click the "Create New List" button, which will become clickable after adding the additional filters that you would like to be applied to the new version. Once you click the button, it will show a prompt to name this new Customer List, which will be created after you name it. The original Customer List will remain the same without the newly-added filters.
:::

See the table below for all filters you can apply to your lists.

## Exporting Data

The complete list of customers in a list can be exported as a .csv file. Exports are processed in the background, and you'll receive an email with a link to download the file. Emails are sent to the logged in account that requested the export. The download links are shareable and available for 30 days.

Below is a description of the .csv format for the exported data.

### Exported files

Customer List exports are CSV files compressed in a GZ file. A GZ file is a compressed file similar to a ZIP file, although it uses a different compression algorithm. The exports use a semicolon delimiter, so if the files are not formatted correctly when viewed as spreadsheets, you may need to change your delimiter settings in the spreadsheet software.

Note that the timestamps in the exports are measured in milliseconds since Unix epoch. To convert these timestamps into a readable date, the formula is `(A1Ã·86400000)+(DATE(1970,1,1))` where `A1` is the corresponding cell.

**macOS**
Can be opened by Archive Utility, included in macOS by default.

**Windows**
Can be opened with a third party utility like WinZip or 7-Zip.

:::info Check for .csv file extension
If you're having trouble opening the exported/uncompressed file, you may need to manually add the .csv extension.
