The Ad Monetized Customers chart tracks the number of unique customers who generated ad revenue by viewing or interacting with ads. This helps you understand the size of your actively monetized user base and identify trends in user engagement with ads.

### Measures

**Ad Monetized Customers**: The count of unique customers who generated ad revenue through impressions or clicks. Each customer is counted once per period, regardless of how many ads they viewed.

### Available settings

- Filters: Yes
- Segments: Yes

### Ad dimensions

Ad charts can be filtered and segmented by ad-specific dimensions like Ad Network, Ad Mediator, Ad Placement, and Ad Unit. See [Ad Impressions](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/ad-impressions-chart#ad-dimensions) for details.

## How to use Ad Monetized Customers in your business

This metric helps you understand user engagement with your ad monetization:

- Track how many of your users are actively contributing to ad revenue
- Compare ad monetized customers against total active users to understand ad exposure
- Segment by country or platform to see where your ad-engaged users are located
- Monitor trends to see if ad monetization is expanding or contracting in your user base
- Combine with ad revenue to calculate average revenue per ad monetized customer
- Use this metric to ensure you're not over-monetizing a small subset of users

## Calculation

For each period, we count the distinct number of customers who generated any ad revenue through impressions or clicks. Each customer is counted only once per period, regardless of how many times they viewed or clicked ads.

## Example

If the same customer views 100 ads in a day, they are counted as 1 ad monetized customer for that day, not 100. This gives you an accurate count of your monetized user base rather than total ad activity.
