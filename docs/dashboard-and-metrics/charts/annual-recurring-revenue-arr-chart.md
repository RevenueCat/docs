## How to use Active Subscriptions Movement in your business

ARR is a common benchmark for subscription companies, and as such is a good way to measure the scale of your business. To understand what’s driving your ARR, segment by key subscriber segments like Store or Product Duration.

## Calculation

For each period, we multiply its MRR by 12 to yield the ARR for that period. Learn more about how MRR is measured [here](/docs/monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr-chart).

| What counts as an active paid subscription for the ARR measurement?                 | Any paid, unexpired subscription is considered active. Learn more [here](/docs/active-subscriptions-chart).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Does ARR exclude subscriptions with auto-renewal disabled?                          | No, ARR includes normalized annual revenue from all active paid subscriptions – even if their auto-renew status is currently disabled. Because of this, if churning subscriptions are not replaced by new paid subscriptions, ARR will be higher than actual realized revenue over a given period. |
| Are non-recurring subscriptions, consumable, or one-time purchases included in ARR? | No, since these purchases do not represent recurring revenue, they are not included in the ARR calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Is ARR calculated before commission and taxes?                                      | Yes, ARR is calculated using the gross price of your active subscriptions. Commission & taxes deducted by the stores would need to be additionally deducted from ARR to understand expected proceeds.                                                                                              |
