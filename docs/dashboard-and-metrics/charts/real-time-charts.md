# Real-time Charts (Beta)

Weâ€™re excited to welcome you to the beta of our new real-time Charts. This release includes powerful updates to how subscriptions are defined and reported, introduces **real-time data refresh**, and adds **new filters and segmentation options** for deeper analysis.

## Summary of changes

### New features

- Charts are now updated in real-time as events occur [Learn more](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/real-time-charts#real-time-reporting)
- New filters & segments for deeper analysis [Learn more](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/real-time-charts#new-and-updated-dimensions)

### Improvements

- Charts are now defined from a consistent subscription definition that is universal across stores, and allows us to distinctly measure cases like a Product Change or a Resubscription separately from a standard Renewal. [Learn more](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/real-time-charts#improved-subscription-definition)
- Refunded transactions no longer cause metrics like Revenue, Conversion to Paying, etc. to change retroactively. Instead, transactions that are later refunded are included by default in all charts, and their revenue is subtracted on the date the refund actually happened. [Learn more](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/real-time-charts#refund-behavior)
- The **Platform** dimension now reports a customer's first seen platform, not their last seen platform, to make analyzing acquisition channels easier and to avoid customer dimensions changing over time.
- The **Country** dimensions now reports the country associated with a customer's app store account (if available), or IP-based location otherwise.
- The current Trial Conversion chart included any future payment on an App Store subscription as a conversion to paid, even if that conversion did not come from the trial start. Now, only conversions to paid from the trial start are included in this chart.

### Bug fixes

- The current Trial Conversion chart was incorrectly including refunded transactions. The new real-time chart now includes them by design, and will soon support the ability to filter them out if desired.

## Supported charts

- Initial conversion
- Trial conversion
- Conversion to paying
- Active Subscriptions
- Active Subscriptions Movement
- Active Trials
- Active Trials Movement
- ARR
- MRR
- MRR Movement

## Detailed changes

### Real-time reporting

Previously, charts refreshed every 2 to 12 hours depending on the dataset. Now, most charts update **in real-time**, providing:

- **Immediate insights** into app performance
- **Improved intra-day monitoring** for launches, experiments, or spikes
- **More consistent data across reports**

You can now make faster, more informed decisions without waiting for batch updates.

### Improved subscription definition

Our new real-time charts are now modeled on our **Subscriptions** entity, which normalizes the various store-specific behaviors down to a common set of definitions that can be measured across stores, and have consistent events created for them.

You can learn more about the subscription data model [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/api-v2#tag/Subscription-Data-Model).

#### Impact

As a result of that change, you'll see some differences in the data our real-time Charts provide.

| Product changes create new subscriptions | When a subscriber changes from one product (A) to another (B), we treat their first subscription to product A as expired, and create a second subscription to product B.      | In charts like New Paid Subscriptions and Active Subscriptions Movement, this results in the count of new subscriptions and churned subscriptions increasing by equal amounts. Other charts like Subscription Retention already treated product changes like new subscriptions, and therefore the count of new subscriptions in a given period should more closely align between these charts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resubscriptions create new subscriptions | When a subscriber starts a subscription after a previous App Store subscription has lapsed, we consider it to be a resubscription, not a renewal on their prior subscription. | In charts like Trial Conversion, payments that would have previously counted as conversions to paid from the original trial start which were actually resubscriptions from a later time are no longer included in the chart. In addition, charts such as New Paid Subscriptions and Active Subscriptions Movement now have new subscriptions and churned subscriptions increasing by equal amounts to account for resubscriptions. Subscription Retention now has an increase in subscriptions, and a proportional decrease in retention for any resubscriptions that were otherwise counted as renewals of prior subscriptions. |

### Refund behavior

To be added

### New and updated dimensions

We've introduced new dimensions for filtering & segmenting, with more coming soon, and have made important updates to existing dimensions to make them more useful.

**New dimensions**

1. App version: Filter & segment charts by the first seen app version of a customer to understand how metrics like conversion rate are impacted by app version
2. Experiment: Filter & segment charts by the experiment & variant that a customer was enrolled in

**Updated dimensions**

1. Platform: Now refers to the first seen platform of a customer, not their last seen platform, so that metrics like conversion rates and LTV can be segmented by the platform a customer originated on without it changing over time (e.g. if a customer converts on the web and then downloads your iOS app)
2. Country: Now prioritizes the app store country of a customer or purchase over the customer's IP-based location. In charts which measure purchases, like Active Subscriptions, the app store storefront that the purchase occurred in will be used as the country; while in charts that measure customer cohorts, like Initial Conversion or Realized LTV per Customer, the first seen app store country of the customer will be used.

:::info Custom attributes
We'll continue to expand segmentation options during the beta, including adding support for filtering & segmenting by custom attributes.

## Getting Started

You can access Real-time Charts from your dashboard by toggling `Real-time` on in Charts. Look for the real-time icon next to supported Charts. To see the current version of each chart, simply toggle `Real-time` off.

As you explore the beta, and have any questions about the experience, [please let us know here](http://typeform.com/),

## Upcoming changes & improvements

- Real-time reporting is available for many charts, but more will be added in the near future. Some charts which do not rely on subscription data, like Customer Center Survey Responses, will be migrated to the real-time system at a later time.
- Real-time charts support App Store, Play Store, and Stripe apps; with additional store support currently in development.
- Support for custom attributes as a filter & segment is in development.
