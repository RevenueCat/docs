The Ad RPM (Revenue Per Mille) chart shows how much you earn for every 1,000 ad impressions. This metric helps you compare monetization efficiency across different time periods, countries, or platforms regardless of total impression volume.

### Measures

**Revenue**: The total amount earned from ads during the period.

**Impressions**: The total number of times ads were displayed to users.

**Impressions in thousands**: The total number of impressions divided by 1,000, used to calculate RPM.

### Calculations

**RPM**: The average revenue earned per 1,000 ad impressions, calculated as (Revenue ÷ Impressions) × 1,000. Higher RPM indicates more effective monetization.

### Available settings

- Filters: Yes
- Segments: Yes

### Ad dimensions

Ad charts can be filtered and segmented by ad-specific dimensions like Ad Network, Ad Mediator, Ad Placement, and Ad Unit. See [Ad Impressions](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/ad-impressions-chart#ad-dimensions) for details.

## How to use Ad RPM in your business

RPM is essential for understanding monetization efficiency independent of scale:

- Compare RPM across countries to identify high-value markets worth targeting
- Track RPM trends to see if monetization efficiency is improving over time
- Segment by platform to optimize ad strategies for iOS vs Android
- Use RPM to evaluate the impact of ad placement changes or new ad formats
- A stable or growing RPM while impressions increase indicates healthy ad monetization
- Compare RPM across app versions to see if updates affect monetization

## Calculation

For each period, we calculate:

1. Total ad revenue
2. Total ad impressions
3. Impressions in thousands = Impressions ÷ 1,000
4. RPM = Revenue ÷ Impressions in thousands

RPM is expressed in your display currency with two decimal places of precision.

## Example

If you earned $500 from 100,000 ad impressions:

- Impressions in thousands = 100,000 ÷ 1,000 = 100
- RPM = $500 ÷ 100 = $5.00

This means you earned $5 for every 1,000 ad impressions.
