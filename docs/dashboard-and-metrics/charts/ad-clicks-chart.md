The Ad Clicks chart tracks the number of times users clicked on ads in your app. Clicks indicate user engagement with ads and can help you understand which ad placements and formats are most effective.

### Measures

### Ad dimensions

Ad charts can be filtered and segmented by ad-specific dimensions like Network Name, Mediator Name, Ad Format, Ad Placement, and Ad Unit. See [Ad Impressions](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/ad-impressions-chart#ad-dimensions) for details.

## How to use Ad Clicks in your business

Ad clicks help you measure user engagement with your advertising:

- Track click trends over time to see how ad engagement evolves
- Segment by platform or country to identify where users are most likely to engage with ads
- Compare clicks against impressions to calculate click-through rate (CTR)
- Use alongside revenue metrics to understand which clicks are most valuable

## Calculation

For each period, we measure the total count of user clicks on ads. Each individual click is counted, representing a moment when a user actively engaged with an advertisement.
