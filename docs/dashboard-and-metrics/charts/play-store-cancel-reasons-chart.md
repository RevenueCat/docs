## How to use Play Store Cancel Reasons in your business

You might use this chart to track the total number of Play Store cancellations occurring over time, or to understand the mix of cancellation reasons that your customers most commonly select. It may be especially useful to track changes in the portion of cancellations coming from each reason over time (tip: use the 100% Stacked column chart type for this), to understand if there are specific moments where the mix shifts that might be attributable to audience or product changes.
