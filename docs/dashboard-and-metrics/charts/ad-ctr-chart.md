The Ad CTR (Click-Through Rate) chart measures how often users click on ads after seeing them. A higher CTR indicates your ads are relevant and engaging to users.

### Measures

**Clicks**: The total number of times users clicked on ads.

**Impressions**: The total number of times ads were displayed to users.

### Calculations

**CTR**: The percentage of ad impressions that resulted in clicks, calculated as (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100.

### Available settings

- Filters: Yes
- Segments: Yes

### Ad dimensions

Ad charts can be filtered and segmented by ad-specific dimensions like Network Name, Mediator Name, Ad Format, Ad Placement, and Ad Unit. See [Ad Impressions](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts/ad-impressions-chart#ad-dimensions) for details.

## How to use Ad CTR in your business

Click-through rate is a key indicator of ad relevance and user engagement:

- Monitor CTR trends to assess whether ad placements and formats are resonating with users
- Segment by country or platform to identify where ads perform best
- Compare CTR across different app versions to see if UI changes affect ad engagement
- A declining CTR may indicate ad fatigue or poor ad placement, while an increasing CTR suggests effective monetization

## Calculation

For each period, we calculate:

1. Total clicks on ads
2. Total ad impressions
3. CTR = (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100

CTR is expressed as a percentage with two decimal places of precision.
