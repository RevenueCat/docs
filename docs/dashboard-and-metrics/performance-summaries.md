## What will be included in my Performance Summary?

Your weekly performance summary will include the following metrics, aggregated for all Projects that you've subscribed to the email for.

| Metric               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| How is a "week" defined in these summaries?                                                                | Just like in Charts, we measure a week as beginning on Sunday and ending the following Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Why are the conversion rate metrics limited to conversions occurring on a first seen day or trial end day? | Since we're delivering this weekly performance summary just one day after the week has ended, we need to ensure that all data points are complete to be accurately compared week over week, and a longer conversion timeframe could result in some days of the week being complete while others are incomplete, skewing the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Why does the Trial Conversion Rate definition differ from Charts?                                          | In order to provide a comparable week over week measurement of Trial Conversion Rate, we're cohorting trials by their **end day** (the final day of the trial), since their end day is what creates the conversion opportunity that we can track and provide as a weekly performance metric with a tight conversion timeframe (described above). Keep in mind that since this definition is divorced from when the customer's journey began, or even when they started their trial (if you offer different trial lengths), if you see an unexpected change in performance we encourage you to visit the Trial Conversion & Active Trials Movement charts to analyze the data and see what may be driving the change. |
| Can I subscribe to individual Performance Summaries for each project?                                      | Not at this time, but it's something we're considering for the future!
