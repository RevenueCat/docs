## Test Cases

This document provides a bunch of key use cases that you can use to verify the successful integration of RevenueCat into your apps. It outlines essential steps and checks to ensure that in-app purchases, subscriptions, and other revenue-related features are functioning as expected as well as helps you take advantage of the many tools that RevenueCat offers. By following these use cases, you can confidently validate your setup and troubleshoot any issues that may arise prior to launching your app.

### Subscription Lifecycle

<details>
  <summary>Purchase Flow</summary>

**Description:** Verify that a user's purchase flow works correctly. For subscriptions, this includes starting a subscription, having the subscription renew, and letting the subscription expire.

**Related docs:**

- [Purchase flow](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/event-flows#subscription-lifecycle)
- [Making purchases](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/making-purchases)

**Preconditions:** App installed, Ensure the device is logged into an account that will make sandbox purchases and RevenueCat configured.

**Steps:**

1. Open the App.
2. Open your Paywall or purchase modal.
3. Select the product that you would like to test.
4. Purchase the product.
5. Open up the RevenueCat [overview](https://app.revenuecat.com/overview) page and check to see if you see a recent purchase for this product with the App User ID of the user that you configured the SDK with.

**Expected Results:** Purchase goes through successfully, the user has the entitlement, and you are able to see the purchase in the RevenueCat dashboard.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:** Purchase is seen on the RevenueCat dashboard.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Refund</summary>

**Description:** Use this test guide to verify that you are able to issue a refund for a user and that your app handles refunds gracefully.

**Related docs:**

- [Handling refunds](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/subscription-guidance/refunds)

**Preconditions:** App installed, App User ID already has a subscription or purchase.

**Steps:**

Google Play:

1. Open the RevenueCat dashboard for the App User ID that you are testing with that has a current subscription.
2. Navigate to the user's purchase event that you would like to refund.
3. Click the refund button in the top right corner of the event details.
4. Verify that the refund has happened by checking the customer history of this user 24 hours later and ensuring that a `CANCELLATION` event has occurred with the reason field set to `CUSTOMER_SUPPORT`.

iOS:

1. When a user tries to issue a refund, verify that you immediately direct them to the Apple support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084
2. Once a user gets a refund granted through Apple, verify that the refund has been seen by us by checking the customer history of this user 24 hours later and ensuring that a `CANCELLATION` event has occurred with the reason field set to `CUSTOMER_SUPPORT`.
   :::warning Sandbox testing

Since granting refunds is done through the App Store themselves, testing this in the sandbox environment is not currently possible
:::

**Expected Results:**

1. Users are able to request a refund
2. For Google Play, you are able to grant the refund via the Dashboard or API
3. For iOS, you direct them to Apple customer support

**Pass/Fail Criteria:** Verify that the refund is seen in RevenueCat in the `CANCELLATION` event.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Cancellation</summary>

**Description:** To test that cancellation events work properly, use this test guide.

**Related docs:**

- [Handling refunds](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/subscription-guidance/managing-subscriptions#cancelling-subscriptions)

**Preconditions:** App installed, RevenueCat configured, and current subscription on App User ID.

**Steps:**

1. Open the app with an App User ID that already has a subscription.
2. Ensure that the subscription is renewed properly.
3. Cancel the subscription through the settings on your device or through our [API](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/api-v1#tag/transactions/operation/cancel-a-google-subscription) for purchases made on Google Play.
4. Verify that the user has received a `CANCELLATION` event on their RevenueCat customer history. We will send this event as soon as the cancellation has started, the actual expiration event will come as soon as the current subscription period ends.

**Expected Results:** Subscription is canceled successfully and we trigger the cancellation event on time.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:** Subscription is canceled and the cancellation event is in the customer history.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Expiration</summary>

**Description:** To verify that a user's subscription has expired, use this test guide.

**Related docs:**

- [Event types](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/integrations/webhooks/event-types-and-fields#event-types)

**Preconditions:** App installed, App User ID has a current subscription.

**Steps:**

1. Open the app.
2. Navigate to your paywall or subscription page and cancel the current subscription.
3. Wait until your current subscription's expiration time and check to ensure that once this time hits the user no longer has access to their entitlements.
4. To verify, check the RevenueCat dashboard of the user for an `EXPIRATION` event at the time of the expiration.

**Expected Results:** Expected Results: The user loses access to the entitlement at the end of the current billing cycle and an `EXPIRATION` event follows at the time of expiration.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:** Verify that the user no longer has access to the entitlement after the expiration has been triggered.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Upgrades and Downgrades</summary>

**Description:** If you have multiple subscription tiers and want to allow people to upgrade/downgrade between them, follow this testing method to ensure everything is working as intended.

**Related docs:**

- [Upgrades, Downgrades, and Management](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/subscription-guidance/managing-subscriptions)

**Preconditions:** App installed, subscription groups set up properly in App Store Connect, and the current logged-in App User ID has a subscription.

**Steps:**

1. Open the app with an app user that already has a subscription.
2. Open the subscription page or paywall in your app.
3. Start a purchase for a subscription that would be an upgrade.
4. Check the RevenueCat dashboard for that App User ID and ensure that you see a `PRODUCT_CHANGE` event.
5. Check the `PRODUCT_CHANGE` event to see that the old product is the correct product and the new product is the correct product that you selected.

**Expected Results:** New subscription starts and old subscription ends.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**

- **Google Play:** The new subscription is started on time based on the `PRORATION` method that you use.
- **iOS:** The new subscription is started on time based on Apple's timing for whether this was an upgrade, downgrade, or crossgrade.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Free Trials and Introductory offers</summary>

**Description:** If you are using free trials and/or intro offers, use this testing method to ensure that eligible users are granted them accordingly.

**Related docs:**

- [Free Trials and Promo Offers](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers)

**Preconditions:** App installed, RevenueCat configured, fresh App User ID created with a new store account, and initial purchases working.

**Steps:**

1. Open the app with a fresh sandbox user.
2. Make sure the paywall and paysheet show the free trial and terms.
3. Purchase the product with the free trial attached.
4. Open that App User ID's customer history in RevenueCat.
5. Verify that the purchase event has a free trial by checking to ensure the `period_type` in their purchase was set to `TRIAL`. If you are checking for an intro offer, ensure that the `period_type` is `INTRO`.

**Expected Results:** The customer history indicates that a trial was started or an intro offer was applied.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:** Subscription is started with the proper offer applied.

</details>
<details>
  <summary> Google Offers </summary>

**Description:** Test Google Play offers using the RevenueCat SDK, including automatic application of trials and introductory offers, and manual offer selection for greater control. This includes verifying the correct application of eligible offers based on pre-defined logic and ensuring that developer-determined offers are handled appropriately.

**Related Docs**

- [RevenueCat Documentation - Google Offers](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/google-play-offers)

**Preconditions:**

- The RevenueCat SDK is integrated into the app.
- Google Play base plans and offers are set up, including free trials, introductory offers, and any developer-determined offers.
- The app has purchase functionality implemented via the RevenueCat SDK.

**Example Code:**

```kotlin
// Example code to select specific offers:
val basePlan = storeProduct.subscriptionOptions?.basePlan
val freeTrialOffer = storeProduct.subscriptionOptions?.freeTrial
val introductoryOffer = storeProduct.subscriptionOptions?.introOffer
val offerForLapsedCustomers = storeProduct.subscriptionOptions?.withTag("lapsed-customers").first()

// To purchase the offer for lapsed customers directly:
Purchases.sharedInstance.purchaseWith(
  PurchaseParams.Builder(requireActivity(), offerForLapsedCustomers).build(),
  onError = { error, userCancelled ->
    // Handle error
  },
  onSuccess = { storeTransaction, customerInfo ->
    // Handle success
  }
)
```

**Steps:**

1. **Automatic Application of Offers**
   - Use `PurchaseParams.Builder` with a `StoreProduct` or `Package`.
   - Verify that the RevenueCat SDK applies the longest eligible free trial or, if not available, the cheapest introductory offer.

2. **Handling Developer-Determined Offers**
   - Set up a developer-determined offer on the Google Play Console.
   - Ensure the offer is tagged with `rc-ignore-offer` if it should not be automatically applied.
   - Test purchasing a product and verify that the tagged offer is not automatically selected.

3. **Manual Offer Selection**
   - Use the `subscriptionOptions` property of a `StoreProduct` to manually select offers, such as the `basePlan`, `freeTrial`, or offers with specific tags.
   - Pass the selected `SubscriptionOption` to `PurchaseParams.Builder` and initiate the purchase.
   - Confirm that the selected offer is correctly applied during the purchase process.

**Expected Results:**

1. **Automatic Application of Offers:**
   - The longest eligible free trial or the cheapest introductory offer is automatically applied as per the defined logic.

2. **Handling Developer-Determined Offers:**
   - Offers with the `rc-ignore-offer` tag are not automatically applied, and developer-determined offers are handled according to the set up in the Google Play Console.

3. **Manual Offer Selection:**
   - The purchase uses the manually selected `SubscriptionOption`, correctly applying the intended offer, such as a specific introductory offer or base plan.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**

- **Pass:** Offers are applied according to the expected logic, with correct handling of automatic and manual selections, and developer-determined offers are not unintentionally applied.

- **Fail:** If the SDK incorrectly applies offers, fails to respect the `rc-ignore-offer` tag, or does not apply the manually selected offer, the test fails.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Display Offering Flow</summary>

**Description:** Test the functionality of displaying products and offerings using the RevenueCat SDK, including fetching offerings, handling placements, and displaying packages based on various configurations. This ensures that products are dynamically presented to users without requiring app updates and that the SDK's offerings configuration works as expected.

**Related Docs**

- [RevenueCat Documentation - Displaying Products](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/displaying-products)

**Preconditions:**

- The RevenueCat SDK is integrated into the app.
- Offerings are configured in the RevenueCat dashboard. \* The app's paywalls are set up to display offerings and packages.

**Example Code:**

```swift
// Fetching Offerings
Purchases.shared.getOfferings { (offerings, error) in
    if let packages = offerings?.current?.availablePackages {
        self.display(packages)
    }
}

// Fetching Offerings by Placement
Purchases.shared.getOfferings { offerings, error in
    if let offering = offerings?.currentOffering(forPlacement: "your-placement-identifier") {
        // TODO: Show paywall
    } else {
        // TODO: Do nothing or continue on to next view
    }
}

// Fetching Custom Offering by Identifier
Purchases.shared.getOfferings { (offerings, error) in
    if let packages = offerings?.offering(identifier: "experiment_group")?.availablePackages {
        self.display(packages)
    }
}
```

**Steps:**

1. **Launch the app and configure the SDK**
   - Start by launching the app and configuring the SDK.

2. **Fetch Offerings**
   - Use the `getOfferings()` method to fetch the current offerings configured in the RevenueCat dashboard.
   - Verify that the default offering and its available packages are displayed correctly.

3. **Fetch Offerings by Placement**
   - Use `getCurrentOffering(forPlacement: "your-placement-identifier")` to fetch offerings based on a specific placement.
   - Check that the correct offering is displayed based on the placement identifier if user fulfills your targeting rules.

4. **Fetch Custom Offering by Identifier**
   - Fetch a specific offering using its identifier (e.g., `"experiment_group"`).
   - Verify that the correct packages associated with the custom offering are displayed.

5. **Display Packages**
   - Use the `.availablePackages` property on an offering to display the available packages.
   - Verify that the packages are grouped correctly according to type (e.g., monthly, annual).

**Expected Results:**

1. **Fetch Offerings:**
   - The SDK fetches the current offerings correctly, and the associated packages are displayed to the user.

2. **Fetch Offerings by Placement:**
   - The correct offering is fetched and displayed based on the specified placement identifier.

3. **Fetch Custom Offering by Identifier:**
   - The SDK correctly retrieves and displays the custom offering identified by its unique identifier.

4. **Display Packages:**
   - Packages are displayed accurately, reflecting the appropriate grouping and type (monthly, annual, etc.).

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**

- **Pass:** Each scenario behaves as expected, with correct updates to the SDK and no unintended behavior.

- **Fail:** If any scenario does not behave as expected—such as incorrect fetching, failure to display offerings, or incorrect handling of empty states—the test fails.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Login/Logout Flow</summary>

**Description:** Test the login behavior in the RevenueCat SDK to ensure that custom and anonymous App User IDs are handled correctly. This includes verifying the merging and switching of IDs and ensuring correct behavior when logging out and logging back in.

**Related Docs**

- [Identifying Customers in RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/identifying-customers)

**Preconditions:**

- The RevenueCat SDK is integrated into the app.
- A unique custom App User ID is available for testing.
- The app's authentication system manages App User IDs.

**Example Code:**

```swift
// Log In with Custom App User ID:
// Configure Purchases on app launch
Purchases.configure(withAPIKey: <my_api_key>)

// Log in with a custom App User ID
Purchases.shared.logIn("<my_app_user_id>") { (customerInfo, created, error) in
    // customerInfo updated for my_app_user_id
}

// Log Out:
// Log out the current user
Purchases.shared.logOut()

// Log In with Another Custom App User ID:
// Log in with another custom App User ID
Purchases.shared.logIn("<another_app_user_id>") { (customerInfo, created, error) in
    // customerInfo updated for another_app_user_id
}
```

**Steps:**

1. **Launch the app and configure the SDK**
   - Start by configuring the SDK without providing an App User ID to generate an anonymous ID.

2. **Log in with a custom App User ID**
   - Use the `.logIn("<my_app_user_id>")` method to log in with a custom App User ID. This should also result in the new app user ID being aliased with the anonymous app user ID.
   - Verify that the `customerInfo` object reflects the custom App User ID.

3. **Log out of the current user**
   - Call the `.logOut()` method to log out.
   - Confirm that a new anonymous App User ID is generated.

4. **Log in again with a different custom App User ID**
   - Use the `.logIn("<another_app_user_id>")` method.
   - Check that the `customerInfo` updates to the new custom App User ID without merging data from the previous session.

5. **Switch accounts without logging out**
   - Directly call the `.logIn()` method with another App User ID without first logging out.
   - Ensure the `customerInfo` correctly switches to the new App User ID without unintended merging.

**Expected Results:**

1. **Initial Log In with Custom App User ID:**
   - The `customerInfo` object should correctly reflect the custom App User ID (`<my_app_user_id>`), showing the associated subscription status and purchase history.

2. **Log Out:**
   - A new anonymous App User ID should be generated, and the `customerInfo` should no longer be associated with the previous custom App User ID.

3. **Log In After Log Out:**
   - Logging in with a different custom App User ID (`<another_app_user_id>`) should update the `customerInfo` object to reflect this new ID, with no data merged from the previous session unless necessary for a restore or similar operation.

4. **Switching Accounts:**
   - When switching from one custom App User ID to another, the `customerInfo` should update to reflect the new custom App User ID without merging.

5. **Anonymous to Custom App User ID:**
   - When logging in from an anonymous ID to a custom App User ID, the SDK should merge or transfer `customerInfo` correctly, depending on the presence of existing aliases or prior configurations. If the custom ID already exists, ensure the correct merging logic is applied.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**

- **Pass:** Each scenario behaves as expected, with correct updates to the `customerInfo` object and no unintended merges or data loss.
- **Fail:** If any scenario does not behave as expected—such as incorrect merging, failure to update `customerInfo`, or retention of previous IDs—the test fails.

### Web Billing (formerly RevenueCat Billing)

<details>
  <summary>Purchase Flow</summary>

**Description:**
Test the purchase flow using the RevenueCat SDK to ensure that subscriptions are correctly initiated when the purchase process is completed. This includes verifying the handling of purchase initiation, completion, and failure scenarios.

**Related Docs:**

- [Subscription Lifecycle](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/web-billing/subscription-lifecycle)

**Preconditions:**

- The RevenueCat SDK is integrated and configured correctly in the app.
- Products are set up in the RevenueCat dashboard.

**Example Code:**

```javascript
try {
  const { customerInfo } = await Purchases.getSharedInstance().purchase({
    rcPackage: pkg,
  });
  if (Object.keys(customerInfo.entitlements.active).includes("pro")) {
    // Unlock "pro" content
  }
} catch (e) {
  if (
    e instanceof PurchasesError &&
    e.errorCode == ErrorCode.UserCancelledError
  ) {
    // User canceled the purchase
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
  }
}
```

**Steps:**

1. Initialize the SDK and ensure it’s correctly configured.
2. Trigger a purchase for a subscription using the SDK.
3. Complete the purchase flow and verify that an `INITIAL_PURCHASE` event is generated.
4. If the purchase is successful, ensure that the customer receives access to the appropriate entitlements.
5. In the case of purchase failure or cancellation, verify that no subscription is created and no events are generated.

**Expected Results:**

- A subscription is created only when the purchase is successfully completed, generating an `INITIAL_PURCHASE` event.
- If the purchase is canceled or fails, no subscription is created and no events are generated.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**

- **Pass:** The purchase flow behaves as expected with correct event generation and entitlement access.
- **Fail:** If the purchase flow does not correctly handle successful or failed purchases, the test fails.
