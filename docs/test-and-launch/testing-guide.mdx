### Using RevenueCat for Entitlements

RevenueCat makes it easy to unlock access using entitlements. Entitlements define the level of access your users should have. You can read more about our guide [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/customers/customer-info).
This approach allows you to utilize RevenueCat as the source of truth by checking the CustomerInfo object to see your users' purchases. This is the recommended approach, as it enables you to seamlessly unlock access, while still allowing you to use your backend as a backup if needed during this setup.

### Using Own Backend for Entitlements

## Migration [Jaz]

### Client Side Migration
A client-side migration is best used when you don't have all the receipts or transaction IDs needed for a full receipt import. This approach allows you to migrate users as they update to the latest version of your app with the RevenueCat SDK integrated. However, it may take longer to get all your users into RevenueCat, as it depends on when they choose to upgrade.

If you do have the receipts or transaction IDs, we recommend performing a full import, as it will provide more complete and accurate data.

You can find more on the client-side migration [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/migrating-to-revenuecat/migrating-existing-subscriptions#client-side-sdk-data-import).

## RevenueCat Tools [Mike] 

### Using RC Paywalls
To ensure that you are making use out of our Paywalls tool correctly, you will want to make sure that you create a paywall via your RevenueCat dashboard and then display these paywalls via our SDK to your users. More information on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls). We also ahve a test guide which will go over use cases that are good to look out for that can be found [here](testing-guide/use-cases).

## Different Identification Setups [Mike]

### Anonymous 
To configure RevenueCat to generate anonymous app user ID's, this will be the easiest configuration setup. All you need to do to ensure your user has an anonymous app user ID in RevenueCat and is able to make purchases and be tracked correctly is configure the SDK without identifying an app user ID on configuration. We have a useful guide which goes over this in more detail [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/customers/user-ids#anonymous-app-user-ids). To ensure that you ahve followed that guide correctly, simply make a fresh sandbox account and open your app. Once this is done, you should be able to see your new user on the RevenueCat dashboard with an anonymous app user ID. 
### Identified 
To configure RevenueCat to use Identified app user ID's, this will also be an easy configuration setup. All you will need to do is ensure that when you configure the RevenueCat SDK, you make sure to add the app user ID taht you would like to be this users app user ID into the configure method. We have a useful guide which goes over this in more detail [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/customers/user-ids#provide-app-user-id-on-configuration). 
### Mixed
To configure RevenueCat to use both Anonymous and Identified app user ID's, this setup will be a little different and dependent on your use case. To do this, you can configure the SDK without identifying an app user ID intially, and then call the `login()` method with the identified app user ID that you would like to have the user login to. More information on this can be found [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/customers/user-ids#provide-app-user-id-after-configuration). Going this route will also allow you to use the `logout()` method with less penalty because calling `logout()` will automatically generate an anonymous app user ID for that user that was previously logged in.
