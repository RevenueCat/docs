Test Store is RevenueCat's built-in testing environment that works immediately without platform setup.

Test Store works automatically with the RevenueCat SDK—no additional configuration is required beyond using your Test Store API key. Test purchases made through Test Store **behave like real purchases and subscriptions**: they update `CustomerInfo`, trigger entitlements, and appear in your RevenueCat dashboard.

:::info SDK Version Requirements
Test Store requires the following minimum SDK versions:

| Platform     | Minimum Version |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| iOS          | 5.43.0          |
| Android      | 9.9.0           |
| Flutter      | 9.8.0           |
| React Native | 9.5.4           |
| Capacitor    | 11.2.6          |
| Cordova      | 7.2.0           |
| Unity        | 8.3.0           |
| KMP          | 2.2.2           |
| Web (JS)     | 1.15.0          |

Older SDK versions will not support Test Store products.

## Getting started

During the setup of a _new_ RevenueCat project, you'll have the option to automatically create a Test Store with your products. You can create them manually after setup following the steps below.

1. Create a Test Store
2. Configure test products and offerings
3. Initialize the SDK with your Test Store API key
4. Make test purchases in your app

### Create a Test Store

If you have not created a Test Store for this project, create one on the **Apps and providers** tab in the sidebar. In the _Test configuration_ section, create a new Test Store and you will be presented with an API key to use in the SDK.

### Configure test products and offerings

Next, create products and attach them to an offering so users can purchase them in your app. Do this in the **Product catalog** tab in the sidebar. Create products for the Test Store in the **Products** tab, then attach those products to an offering in the **Offerings** tab. Alternatively, if you already have an existing offering, you can create the Test Store products directly on the offering edit page.

### Initialize the SDK with your Test Store API key

To configure your SDK to use the Test Store instead of the real store, use the **Test Store API Key** generated above whenever you [initialize the RevenueCat SDK](/getting-started/configuring-sdk#testing-with-test-store). Before shipping to production, switch this key back to the platform-specific API keys for each platform your app supports. You can find all your keys in **Project Settings > API keys**.

:::danger CRITICAL: Never submit apps with a Test Store API key
**Never submit an app to the App Store or Google Play that is configured with a Test Store API key.** Always use the correct platform-specific API key (iOS, Android, etc.) for release builds.

We recommend using build configurations or environment variables to automatically select the correct API key for each build type:

- **Development/Debug builds**: Test Store API key
- **Production/Release builds**: Platform-specific API key (iOS, Android, etc.)

### Make test purchases in your app

Once the SDK is configured with the correct Test Store API key, you can start making test purchases in your app. Instead of invoking the system in-app purchase flow, your app will present a modal with metadata about the product being purchased, along with buttons to simulate a successful purchase, a failed purchase, or cancel the purchase entirely.

Use these options to manually test how your code responds to different in-app purchase outcomes, or to write automated integration tests without interacting with real store flows.

Purchases through Test Store will be reported as sandbox data. Learn more at [Viewing Non-Production Data](/test-and-launch/sandbox#viewing-non-production-data).

:::tip Control test purchase behavior
You can control whether test purchases (both Test Store and platform sandboxes) grant entitlements using [Sandbox Testing Access](/projects/sandbox-access) settings. This is useful for restricting testing to specific app user IDs.

## Subscription renewals and expiration

When testing subscriptions in the Test Store, renewals and expirations occur much faster than with real purchases. **Each test subscription will renew automatically up to 5 times**, after which it will cancel and its associated entitlements will become inactive.

| Product Duration | Test Store Renewal Interval | Total Time Until Subscription Ends (after 5 renewals) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 week           | 5 minutes                   | 25 minutes                                            |
| 1 month          | 5 minutes                   | 25 minutes                                            |
| 2 months         | 10 minutes                  | 50 minutes                                            |
| 3 months         | 15 minutes                  | 75 minutes                                            |
| 6 months         | 30 minutes                  | 150 minutes                                           |
| 1 year           | 1 hour                      | 5 hours                                               |
