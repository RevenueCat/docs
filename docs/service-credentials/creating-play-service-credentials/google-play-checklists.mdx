The processes for setting up Google Play service credentials and real-time developer notifications to communicate with RevenueCat on your behalf can be complex, and span across multiple consoles and dashboards. Use this handy checklist to go through and make sure you hit each step in your configuration.

Note that while our [credentials guide](/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials) and our [developer notifications guide](/platform-resources/server-notifications/google-server-notifications) will move back and forth between the Google Play Console, the Google Cloud Console, and the RevenueCat dashboard, we've combined the steps into categories for ease of use.
