## How the Integration Works

### Customer Matching

The integration automatically attempts to match Intercom conversation contacts to RevenueCat customers using several methods:

1. **Profile-Based Matching**: If a contact has been previously linked to a RevenueCat customer, the app will automatically display their information
2. **Message Content Parsing**: The app automatically extracts customer IDs from conversation messages (see details below)
3. **Email Matching**: The app searches your RevenueCat project for customers with the same email address as the conversation contact
4. **Manual Search**: When automatic matching doesn't find a customer, support agents can manually search by email or customer ID

### Automatic Customer ID Extraction

The integration can automatically extract RevenueCat customer IDs from conversation messages when they follow specific formats. This is particularly useful for automated emails sent from your app or when customers include their customer ID in support requests.

**How It Works:**

The integration looks for text in conversation messages that:

- Start at the beginning of a line
- Optionally begin with "RC" followed by a space
- Contain one of these keywords: "customer", "user", or "install"
- Optionally have "id" after the keyword (with optional spaces, underscores, or dashes)
- Are followed by a colon ":" with optional spaces around it
- Have a customer ID value (1-100 characters, no line breaks or slashes)
- End at the end of the line

The matching is case-insensitive, so "Customer ID", "customer id", and "CUSTOMER ID" all work.

**Implementation Examples:**

When sending support emails from your app, include the customer ID in one of these formats. You can put this at the bottom of the email with some other debug information you might already be sending:

```
// Example 1: Basic format
Customer ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv

// Example 2: With RC prefix
RC Customer ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv

// Example 3: Alternative formats
User ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
Install ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
```

### What You'll See

When the integration successfully finds a customer, you'll see:

**Customer Overview:**

- Customer ID and project information
- Total lifetime value across all purchases
- Country, app version, and platform details
- Last activity and account creation dates

**Subscription Details:**

- Active and past subscriptions
- Product names and subscription status
- Revenue data and renewal dates
- Store information (App Store, Play Store, etc.)

**Purchase History:**

- One-time purchases and consumables
- Purchase dates and quantities
- Revenue breakdown by transaction

**Custom Attributes:**

- Any custom attributes you've set in RevenueCat
- Expandable view for easy access

## Using the Integration Effectively

### Quick Actions

**View in RevenueCat Dashboard:**

- Click the **View in RevenueCat** button to open the customer's full profile in a new tab
- Perfect for detailed analysis or making subscription changes

**Copy Customer Information:**

- Click the copy icon next to customer IDs and other data
- Easily share information with team members or other tools

**Sync Customers to Profiles:**

- Use the **Match customer with Intercom profile** button to create persistent associations
- Future conversations with the same contact will automatically show customer data

### Manual Search Tips

When automatic matching doesn't work:

1. **Search by Email**: Use the exact email address from the customer's account
2. **Search by Customer ID**: Use the RevenueCat customer ID if you have it
3. **Multiple Results**: If multiple customers share an email, you'll see a list to choose from
4. **No Results**: The integration will clearly indicate when no customer is found

### Profile Syncing (Advanced)

Profile syncing provides:

- **Persistent Associations**: Once synced, future conversations automatically show customer data
- **Team Efficiency**: All agents see the same customer information
- **Reduced Lookups**: Eliminates repeated manual searches for the same customers

## Data Privacy & Security

### Your Customer Data

- All customer data is retrieved in real-time from RevenueCat
- No customer information is stored by the Intercom integration
- Data transmission uses industry-standard TLS encryption

### Access Control

### Compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Customer Data Not Found:**
