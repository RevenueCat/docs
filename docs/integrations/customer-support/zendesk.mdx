- Admin access to your RevenueCat project
- RevenueCat Project ID (found in your project settings)
- RevenueCat API v2 secret key (create one in your API Keys settings)

### Zendesk Requirements

## Installation & Configuration

### 1. RevenueCat Setup

**Obtain Project ID:**

1. Navigate to your RevenueCat dashboard
2. Go to **Project Settings** → **General**
3. Copy your Project ID (format: `proj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

**Generate API Key:**

1. In RevenueCat dashboard, go to **Project Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Create a new secret API key (v2), or use an existing v2 key
3. Set key permissions to be `Customer information -> Read only` at a minimum
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk_`)

### 2. Zendesk App Installation

1. Visit the [RevenueCat Customer Profiles app](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1138597/revenuecat-customer-profiles/) in the Zendesk Marketplace
2. Click **Install** and log into your Zendesk Admin Center if prompted
3. Follow the installation prompts to add the app to your Zendesk instance

### 3. App Configuration

**Configure the Integration:**

1. In Zendesk Admin Center, go to **Apps and integrations** → **Apps** → **Manage**
2. Find "RevenueCat Customer Profiles" in your installed apps
3. Click the gear icon and select **Change settings**
4. Enter your configuration:
   - **RevenueCat Project ID**: Paste your project ID from step 1
   - **RevenueCat API v2 Secret Key**: Paste your API key from step 1
5. Click **Update** to save your settings

**Verify Installation:**

1. Open any Zendesk Support ticket
2. Look for the RevenueCat app in the right sidebar
3. The app should display "Loading..." initially, then show customer data or search options

## How the Integration Works

### Customer Matching

The integration automatically attempts to match Zendesk ticket requesters to RevenueCat customers using several methods:

1. **Profile-Based Matching**: If a requester has been previously linked to a RevenueCat customer, the app will automatically display their information
2. **Ticket Description Parsing**: The app automatically extracts customer IDs from ticket descriptions (see details below)
3. **Email Matching**: The app searches your RevenueCat project for customers with the same email address as the ticket requester
4. **Manual Search**: When automatic matching doesn't find a customer, support agents can manually search by email or customer ID

### Automatic Customer ID Extraction

The integration can automatically extract RevenueCat customer IDs from ticket descriptions when they follow specific formats. This is particularly useful for automated emails sent from your app.

**How It Works:**

The integration looks for lines in ticket descriptions that:

- Start at the beginning of a line
- Optionally begin with "RC" followed by a space
- Contain one of these keywords: "customer", "user", or "install"
- Optionally have "id" after the keyword (with optional spaces, underscores, or dashes)
- Are followed by a colon ":" with optional spaces around it
- Have a customer ID value (1-100 characters, no line breaks or slashes)
- End at the end of the line

The matching is case-insensitive, so "Customer ID", "customer id", and "CUSTOMER ID" all work.

**Implementation Examples:**

When sending support emails from your app, include the customer ID in one of these formats. You can put this at the bottom of the email with some other debug information you might already be sending:

```
// Example 1: Basic format
Customer ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv

// Example 2: With RC prefix
RC Customer ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv

// Example 3: Alternative formats
User ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
Install ID: 12345abc-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
```

### What You'll See

When the integration successfully finds a customer, you'll see:

**Customer Overview:**

- Customer ID and project information
- Total lifetime value across all purchases
- Country, app version, and platform details
- Last activity and account creation dates

**Subscription Details:**

- Active and past subscriptions
- Product names and subscription status
- Revenue data and renewal dates
- Store information (App Store, Play Store, etc.)

**Purchase History:**

- One-time purchases and consumables
- Purchase dates and quantities
- Revenue breakdown by transaction

**Custom Attributes:**

- Any custom attributes you've set in RevenueCat
- Expandable view for easy access

## Using the Integration Effectively

### Quick Actions

**View in RevenueCat Dashboard:**

- Click the **View in RevenueCat** button to open the customer's full profile in a new tab
- Perfect for detailed analysis or making subscription changes

**Copy Customer Information:**

- Click the copy icon next to customer IDs and other data
- Easily share information with team members or other tools

**Link Customers to Profiles:**

- Use the **Match customer with Zendesk profile** button to create persistent associations
- Future tickets from the same requester will automatically show customer data

### Manual Search Tips

When automatic matching doesn't work:

1. **Search by Email**: Use the exact email address from the customer's account
2. **Search by Customer ID**: Use the RevenueCat customer ID if you have it
3. **Multiple Results**: If multiple customers share an email, you'll see a list to choose from
4. **No Results**: The integration will clearly indicate when no customer is found

### Profile Linking (Advanced)

For Zendesk Suite customers, profile linking provides:

- **Persistent Associations**: Once linked, future tickets automatically show customer data
- **Team Efficiency**: All agents see the same customer information
- **Reduced Lookups**: Eliminates repeated manual searches for the same customers

## Data Privacy & Security

### Access Control
