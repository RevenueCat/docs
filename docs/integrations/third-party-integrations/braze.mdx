Braze can be a helpful integration tool in understanding what stage a customer is in and reacting accordingly. Using Braze can help you to create content that understands the context of your customers and their actions.

With our Braze integration, you can:

- Send an onboarding campaign to a user towards the end of their free trial.
- Track purchases to understand revenue generated by each user
- Allow customer support to grant a promotional subscription to a loyal user that experience issues.
- Send campaigns to users who canceled their subscription or didn’t pursue after their free trial.

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in Braze, you'll be set to turbocharge your campaigns ⚡️

## Events

The Braze integration tracks the following events:

| Event                     | Default Event Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | App Store | Play Store | Amazon | Stripe | Promo |

RevenueCat customer attributes will be dispatched to Braze with the events detailed above and will populate in Braze's [custom attributes](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/) for a customer as `rc_customer_attribute_*` (where `*` is replaced by the attribute name) and the value is set to that key (e.g: `rc_customer_attribute_naps_logged: "123”`). If you are setting the optional Braze User Alias Object fields in RevenueCat, these attributes will be filtered out from the collection before we dispatch the custom attributes to Braze.

RevenueCat will also send your customer's active entitlement ID(s) as an array of `rc_active_entitlement_ids`.

### Revenue tracking

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Braze.

In order to have these events recognized as `purchases` in Braze, be sure to keep the **Send as purchase objects** box checked when creating your integration. [Learn more about Braze purchases.](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/purchase_object#what-is-a-purchase-object)

You can identify the RevenueCat event name using the `rc_event_name` field attached to the purchase.

![Braze purchases](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/braze/braze-purchases.png)

:::warning Updating existing integrations to send purchases
RevenueCat began supporting Braze purchases in February 2025. Purchases and custom events are treated as entirely different events in Braze, so if your existing Braze integration sends custom events and you enable sending purchase objects instead, future purchases will be treated as brand new events in Braze.

If your Braze integration has **Send as purchase objects** unchecked, then it currently sends revenue-generating events as custom events.

:::

## Setup

### 1. Set Braze User Identity

If you're using the Braze SDK, you can set the User Id to match the RevenueCat App User Id. This way, events sent from the Braze SDK and events sent from RevenueCat can be synced to the same user.

Configure the Braze SDK with the same App User Id as RevenueCat or use the `.changeUser()` method on the Braze SDK.

    { type: "dart", title: "Flutter", content: flutterContent },
  ]}
/>

### (Optional) Send User Alias Object fields to RevenueCat

If you are looking to send an alternative unique user identifier that is different than your App User ID, update Customers with the below data as [Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes).

| Key                | Description                                                                                                       |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$brazeAliasName`  | The Braze 'alias_name' in [User Alias Object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object/)  |
| `$brazeAliasLabel` | The Braze 'alias_label' in [User Alias Object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object/) |

Both attributes are required for the [User Alias Object](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object/) to be sent alongside your event data. These properties can be set and removed manually, like any other [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes).

RevenueCat will always use the User Alias Object to identify events into Braze, if set, as opposed to the RevenueCat App User ID.

:::danger Remove an client-side purchase tracking
Make sure to remove all client-side tracking of revenue. Since RevenueCat will be sending events for all revenue actions, tracking purchases with the Braze SDK directly can lead to double counting of revenue in Braze.
:::

### 2. Send RevenueCat Events to Braze

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ and Braze SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'Braze' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Add your Braze instance and API key
3. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
4. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

## Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to Braze, we'll update the `rc_subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| active              | The customer has an active, paid subscription which is set to renew at their next renewal date.                                            |
| intro               | The customer has an active, paid subscription through a paid introductory offer.                                                           |
| cancelled           | The customer has a paid subscription which is set to expire at their next renewal date.                                                    |
| grace_period        | The customer has a paid subscription which has entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| trial               | The customer is in a trial period which is set to convert to paid at the end of their trial period.                                        |
| cancelled_trial     | The customer is in a trial period which is set to expire at the end of their trial period.                                                 |
| grace_period_trial  | The customer was in a trial period and has now entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| expired             | The customer's subscription has expired.                                                                                                   |
| promotional         | The customer has access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat [Granted Entitlement](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#entitlements) |
| expired_promotional | The customer previously had access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat Granted Entitlement that has since expired.                      |
| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.                                       |

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred. Therefore, we recommend using `rc_active_entitlements` to understand whether your customers have multiple active subscriptions to be accounted for.

Please note that since this attribute is set and updated when events are delivered, subscribers with events prior to our release of this attribute (during November 2023) will not have this attribute set until/unless a future event (renewal, cancellation, etc) occurs.
