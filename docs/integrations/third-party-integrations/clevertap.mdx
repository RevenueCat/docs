CleverTap can be a useful integration tool for seeing all events and revenue that occur for your app even if it’s not active for a period of time. You can use CleverTap’s analytics and marketing tools to reach your goal of increasing user engagement and retention.

With our CleverTap integration, you can:

- Create a campaign that triggers when a user completes a certain event; ex. Send a notification with a discount code when they cancel their subscription.
- Gather metrics on user purchases by tracking events over time.

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in CleverTap, you'll be set to turbo-charge your user engagement ⚡️

## Setup

### 1. Send CleverTap Identity to RevenueCat

The CleverTap integration can send the CleverTap ID to CleverTap as the user identity. To do that, you will need to update the following [Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes) for the Customer.

| Key            | Description                                                                                                              | Required |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `$cleverTapId` | The [CleverTap ID](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/concepts-user-profiles#section-identifying-a-user) for the user. | ✅       |

This property can be set manually, like any other [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes). If you do not set this property, the [App User ID](/customers/user-ids) will be sent as the user identity to CleverTap.

### 2. Send RevenueCat Events to CleverTap

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ and CleverTap SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'CleverTap' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Add your [CleverTap Account ID and Passcode](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/api-quickstart-guide).
3. If you want to test in sandbox, also add your Sandbox Account ID and Passcode from your testing account.
4. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
5. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.
6. Choose your CleverTap region.

:::info
By default, RevenueCat sends data through CleverTap's EU data center. For CleverTap customers who have a regional data center configured, you can change your region in the dropdown selector under 'CleverTap Region'.
