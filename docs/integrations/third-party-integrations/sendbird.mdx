RevenueCat can automatically send subscription lifecycle events to Sendbird, enabling you to sync user subscription status with your chat and messaging platform.

With our Sendbird integration, you can:

- Update user metadata with subscription status in real-time
- Track which users have active subscriptions in Sendbird
- Trigger in-app messaging based on subscription events
- Personalize chat experiences based on subscription tier

## Setup

### 1. Get your Sendbird Application ID and API Token

1. Log in to your [Sendbird Dashboard](https://dashboard.sendbird.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Application** → **General**
3. Copy your **Application ID** (displayed at the top of the page)
4. Under **API tokens**, copy your **Master API token** or generate a **Secondary API token**

:::warning Security Note
Sendbird recommends using secondary API tokens for external integrations. You can generate these in your dashboard and revoke them if compromised without affecting other integrations.
:::

### 2. Configure in RevenueCat

1. Go to your RevenueCat project
2. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Sendbird**
3. Enter your **Application ID**
4. Enter your **API Token**
5. Configure event names (optional - defaults are provided)
6. Click **Save**

## How It Works

When a subscription event occurs in RevenueCat, we update the user in Sendbird using their `app_user_id`. The integration:

1. Calls the Sendbird API to update the user's metadata
2. Stores subscription status in user metadata fields:
   - `rc_event`: The event name
   - `rc_product_id`: The product identifier
   - `rc_entitlement_ids`: Comma-separated list of active entitlements
   - `rc_subscription_status`: Current subscription status

## User Matching

The Sendbird integration uses the RevenueCat `app_user_id` to identify users in Sendbird. Ensure your users are created in Sendbird with the same identifier you use for RevenueCat.

## Testing

1. Configure the integration with your Sendbird credentials
2. Make a sandbox purchase in your app
3. In your Sendbird Dashboard, navigate to **Users** and find the user
4. Verify the user's metadata contains the RevenueCat subscription data

## Sample Event Payload

When RevenueCat sends an event, it updates the Sendbird user with a payload like:

```json
{
  "nickname": "user_display_name",
  "metadata": {
    "rc_event": "rc_initial_purchase_event",
    "rc_product_id": "premium_monthly",
    "rc_entitlement_ids": "pro,premium",
    "rc_subscription_status": "active",
    "rc_event_data": "{...}"
  }
}
```
