excerpt: Integrate in-app subscription events from RevenueCat with mParticle
hidden: false
---

mParticle can be a useful integration tool for seeing all events and revenue that occur for your app even if it’s not active for a period of time. You can use mParticle to clean up your data infrastructure and collect new customer data, which can then be connected with other tools through mParticle’s powerful API.

With our mParticle integration, you can:

- Use the API to identify users who are at risk of churning and begin a campaign to win them back.
- Set up push notifications and emails to users who have subscribed to your product but do not engage very much.

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in mParticle, you'll be set to turbocharge your campaigns ⚡️

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in mParticle.

## Setup

### 1. Set mParticle User Identity and Send Device Data to RevenueCat

If you're using the mParticle SDK, you can set the User ID to match the RevenueCat App User Id. This way, events sent from the mParticle SDK and events sent from RevenueCat can be synced to the same user.

The mParticle integration also requires some device-specific data. RevenueCat will only send events into mParticle if the below [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes) keys have been set for the device.

| Key            | Description                                                                                                                                     | Required         |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| `$mparticleId` | The unique mParticle user identifier (mpid).                                                                                                    | ✅ (recommended) |
| `$idfa`        | iOS [advertising identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/1614151-advertisingidentifier) UUID        | ❌ (optional)    |
| `$idfv`        | iOS [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor) UUID                              | ❌ (optional)    |
| `$gpsAdId`     | Google [advertising identifier](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info) | ❌ (optional)    |
| `$ip`          | The IP address of the device                                                                                                                    | ❌ (optional)    |

:::warning Android ID deprecation
Due to policy changes from the Play Store, Android ID is no longer collected by RevenueCat's Android SDKs starting on versions 6.9.8+, 7.11.1+, and later major versions.

Therefore, Google's Advertising ID acts as the primary device identifier for Android devices in RevenueCat and when connecting with third-party integrations.
:::

These properties can be set manually, like any other [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes), or through the helper methods `collectDeviceIdentifiers()` and `setMparticleId()`.

Create an `identityRequest` and add it to the `MParticleOptions` that you pass to the `start()` method on the mParticle SDK to set the same App User Id that is set in RevenueCat.

import swiftContent from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_1.swift?raw";
import objectiveCContent from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_2.m?raw";
import javaContent from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_3.java?raw";

  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: swiftContent },
    { type: "objc", content: objectiveCContent },
    { type: "java", content: javaContent },

/>

mParticle also allows you to log a user in after starting the SDK and log a user out; you should handle both of these cases:

import swiftContent2 from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_4.swift?raw";
import objectiveCContent2 from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_5.m?raw";
import javaContent2 from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_6.java?raw";

  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: swiftContent2 },
    { type: "objc", content: objectiveCContent2 },
    { type: "java", content: javaContent2 },
  ]}
/>

import swiftContent3 from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_7.swift?raw";
import objectiveCContent3 from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle_8.m?raw";

  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: swiftContent3 },
    { type: "objc", content: objectiveCContent3 },
    { type: "java", content: javaContent3 },
  ]}
/>

:::danger Device identifiers with iOS App Tracking Transparency (iOS 14.5+)
If you are requesting the App Tracking permission through ATT to access the IDFA, you can call `.collectDeviceIdentifiers()` _again_ if the customer accepts the permission to update the `$idfa` attribute in RevenueCat.
:::

### 2. Add RevenueCat Feed Inputs in mParticle

In mParticle, add the RevenueCat feed input and create two feeds: one for the Android platform and one for the iOS platform. Copy each feed's Server to Server Key and Server to Server Secret for setup on RevenueCat. Refer to [mParticle's documentation](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/feeds/) to learn more about feeds.

:::warning
RevenueCat requires [Create & Update Profile](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/personalization/profiles/#input-protections) permissions in order to send purchase & subscription lifecycle events into mParticle.
:::

![Add RevenueCat feed inputs](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle/add-revenuecat-feed-inputs.png)

### 3. Send RevenueCat events to mParticle

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ and mParticle SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'mParticle' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Add your **Server to Server Keys** and **Server to Server Secrets** for each platform from step 2
3. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
4. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

### 4. Testing the mParticle integration

You can test the mParticle integration end-to-end before going live. It's recommended that you test the integration is working properly for new users, and any existing users that may update their app to a new version.

#### Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

#### Check that the required device data is collected

Navigate the the [Customer View](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history/basic-information) for the test user that just made a purchase. Make sure that all of the required data from step 1 above is listed as attributes for the user.

![](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle/mparticle-device-data.png)

#### Check that the mParticle event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, click into the test purchase event in the [Customer History](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history) and make sure that the mParticle integration event exists and was delivered successfully.

![](/docs_images/integrations/third-party-integrations/mparticle/event-delivered.png)

:::success
You should start seeing events from RevenueCat appear in mParticle
