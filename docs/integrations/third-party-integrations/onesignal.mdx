excerpt: Integrate RevenueCat subscription status with OneSignal
hidden: false
---

OneSignal can be a useful integration tool for understanding what stage a customer is in to react accordingly. RevenueCat can automatically update user tags in OneSignal with their latest subscription status.

With our OneSignal integration, you can:

- Send an onboarding campaign to a user in a free trial
- Send a message to churned users and [offer them a discount](/subscription-guidance/subscription-offers/ios-subscription-offers)

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in OneSignal, you'll be set to turbocharge your campaigns ⚡️

For every auto-renewing subscription event in RevenueCat, the following tags get added or updated on the user in OneSignal. By leaving the tag blank in the RevenueCat dashboard, you can choose to not send any value for specific tag(s).

## 1. Send device data to RevenueCat

### 1.1 User-centric API versions of OneSignal (v5 SDK and above)

The OneSignal integration requires some user-specific data. RevenueCat will only update users in OneSignal if the below data has been added as [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes) for the user.

| Key                | Description                                                                                                    | Required |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `$onesignalUserId` | The [OneSignal ID](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#user-properties) used to represent the user. | ✅       |

This property can be set manually, like any other [Subscriber Attributes](doc:subscriber-attributes), or through the helper method `setOnesignalUserID()`.

Make sure to call OneSignal's [`login` method](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/mobile-sdk-reference#login-external-id) before sending the OneSignal Id as this may change.

You can [listen for changes to the OneSignal Id through their SDK](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/mobile-sdk-reference#addobserver-user-state), and send the value to RevenueCat. If you already have OneSignal set up, you should make sure that you're also sending the OneSignal Id for users that are updating to the latest version of your app.

### 1.2 Device-centric API versions of OneSignal (v4 SDK and below)

The OneSignal integration requires some device-specific data. RevenueCat will only update users in OneSignal if the below data has been added as [Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes) for the Customer.

| Key            | Description                                                                                       | Required |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| `$onesignalId` | The [OneSignal Player Id](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#player-id) for the user. | ✅       |

This property can be set manually, like any other [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes), or through the helper method `setOnesignalID()`.

You can listen for changes to the OneSignal Id through their SDK, and send the value to RevenueCat. If you already have OneSignal set up, you should make sure that you're also sending the OneSignal Id for users that are updating to the latest version of your app.

import onesignalV9Content from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/third-party-integrations/onesignal_1.swift?raw";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[{ type: "swift", content: onesignalV9Content }]} />

## 2. Send RevenueCat events into OneSignal

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ to send device data to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the tag names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'OneSignal' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Add your **OneSignal App Id** and **OneSignal API key**.
3. Enter the tag names that RevenueCat should use, or choose the default tag names.

## 3. Testing the OneSignal integration

You can test the OneSignal integration end-to-end before going live. It's recommended that you test the integration is working properly for new users, and any existing users that may update their app to a new version.

### Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

### Check that the required device data is collected

Navigate the the [Customer View](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history/basic-information) for the test user that just made a purchase. Make sure that all of the required data from step 1 above is listed as attributes for the user.

### Check that the OneSignal event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, click into the test purchase event in the [Customer History](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history) and make sure that the OneSignal integration event exists and was delivered successfully.

## Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to OneSignal, we'll send a `subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| active              | The customer has an active, paid subscription which is set to renew at their next renewal date.                                            |
| intro               | The customer has an active, paid subscription through a paid introductory offer.                                                           |
| cancelled           | The customer has a paid subscription which is set to expire at their next renewal date.                                                    |
| grace_period        | The customer has a paid subscription which has entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| trial               | The customer is in a trial period which is set to convert to paid at the end of their trial period.                                        |
| cancelled_trial     | The customer is in a trial period which is set to expire at the end of their trial period.                                                 |
| grace_period_trial  | The customer was in a trial period and has now entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| expired             | The customer's subscription has expired.                                                                                                   |
| promotional         | The customer has access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat [Granted Entitlement](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history/promotionals) |
| expired_promotional | The customer previously had access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat Granted Entitlement that has since expired.                      |
| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.                                       |

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred.

Please note that since this attribute is set and updated when events are delivered, subscribers with events prior to our release of this attribute (during November 2023) will not have this attribute set until/unless a future event (renewal, cancellation, etc) occurs.
