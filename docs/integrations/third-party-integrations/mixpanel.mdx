For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in Mixpanel.

## Setup

### 1. Set Mixpanel User Identity

If you're using the Mixpanel SDK, you can set the Distinct Id to match the RevenueCat App User Id. This way, events sent from the Mixpanel SDK and events sent from RevenueCat can be synced to the same user.

Use the `.identify()` method on the Mixpanel SDK to set the same App User ID that is set in RevenueCat.

##### Reserved Mixpanel Customer Attribute

We recommend keeping the Mixpanel SDK identifier the same as RevenueCat's App User ID as described above. Alternatively, if you want Mixpanel events tied to a different identifier, you can set a attribute for `$mixpanelDistinctId` that is sent with events instead of RevenueCat's App User ID.

If a user has that attribute set it will be used instead of the RevenueCat App User ID in the Mixpanel events.

### 2. Send RevenueCat Events to Mixpanel

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ and Mixpanel SDK, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose 'Mixpanel' from the Integrations menu

![Integration setup](/docs_images/integrations/setup-integrations.png)

2. Add your Mixpanel Project token
3. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
4. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

## Sample Events

## Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to Mixpanel, we'll update the `rc_subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| active              | The customer has an active, paid subscription which is set to renew at their next renewal date.                                            |
| intro               | The customer has an active, paid subscription through a paid introductory offer.                                                           |
| cancelled           | The customer has a paid subscription which is set to expire at their next renewal date.                                                    |
| grace_period        | The customer has a paid subscription which has entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| trial               | The customer is in a trial period which is set to convert to paid at the end of their trial period.                                        |
| cancelled_trial     | The customer is in a trial period which is set to expire at the end of their trial period.                                                 |
| grace_period_trial  | The customer was in a trial period and has now entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| expired             | The customer's subscription has expired.                                                                                                   |
| promotional         | The customer has access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat [Granted Entitlement](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile#entitlements) |
| expired_promotional | The customer previously had access to an entitlement through a RevenueCat Granted Entitlement that has since expired.                      |
| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.                                       |

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred.

Please note that since this attribute is set and updated when events are delivered, subscribers with events prior to our release of this attribute (during November 2023) will not have this attribute set until/unless a future event (renewal, cancellation, etc) occurs.
