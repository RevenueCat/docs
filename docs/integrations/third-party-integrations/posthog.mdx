The PostHog integration is to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans. If you're on a legacy Free or Starter plan and want to access this integration, migrate to our new pricing via your [billing settings](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/billing).
:::

PostHog can be a useful integration tool for seeing all events and revenue that occur for your app even if it’s not active for a period of time. You can use PostHog's product analytics to find patterns in customer behavior and inform marketing strategies.

With our PostHog integration, you can:

- Create a behavioral cohort of customers based on specific actions, such as watching a specific episode of a show after subscribing. Follow a cohort throughout their lifecycle to realize overarching trends.
- Measure the path of a user from marketing material to the purchase of a subscription.

With accurate and up-to-date subscription data in PostHog, you'll be set to turbocharge your product analytics ⚡️

For events that have revenue, such as trial conversions and renewals, RevenueCat will automatically record this amount along with the event in PostHog. Bear in mind that revenue will always be reported in USD. If it's been made with a different currency, we'll automatically convert it to USD. You can find the currency of the original transaction in the `currency` field of the event.

## Setup

### 1. Set PostHog User Identity

In order to associate RevenueCat data with a PostHog User, the RevenueCat `$posthogUserId` [Attribute](/customers/customer-attributes) should be set in RevenueCat. If this field does not exist, RevenueCat will fallback to the RevenueCat app user ID. You can read more about PostHog user profiles in PostHog's [Identifying users](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/identify) documentation.

### 2. Send RevenueCat Events to PostHog

After you've set up the Purchase SDK and PostHog SDK to have the same user identity, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your app in the RevenueCat and find the _Integrations_ card in the left menu. Select **+ New**

![](/images/82692c7-app.revenuecat.com_projects_85ff18c7_collaborators_1_73d6dc81e85972dbbc157674b1182fb8.png)

2. Choose **PostHog** from the Integrations menu
3. Add your PostHog [Project API key](https://posthog.com/docs/api) to the **API key** field in RevenueCat. The integration uses only public endpoints, so there is no need to set up personal API keys.
4. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names
5. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

:::info PostHog sandbox environment
PostHog recommends having a production and sandbox project to separate live and testing environments. You can input both keys in the RevenueCat PostHog settings page.
:::

## Testing the PostHog integration

### Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete the [sandbox purchase](/test-and-launch/sandbox).

### Check that the PostHog event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, select the purchase event in the [Customer History](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history) page and make sure that the PostHog integration event exists and was delivered successfully.

![Check that the PostHog event was delivered](/images/posthog_event_details.png "Check that the PostHog event was delivered")

### Check the PostHog dashboard for the delivered event

Navigate to your PostHog dashboard > People and groups. In the 'People &amp; groups' tab, you will see the event's user created as a Person.

![Check that a PostHog Person has been created](/images/posthog_people_and_groups.png "Check that a PostHog Person has been created")

Navigate to your PostHog dashboard > Data management. In the 'Events' tab, you will see events RevenueCat has dispatched to PostHog.

## Subscription Status Attribute

Whenever RevenueCat sends an event to PostHog, we'll update the `rc_subscription_status` user attribute with any applicable changes, using one of the following values:

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| cancelled_trial     | The customer is in a trial period which is set to expire at the end of their trial period.                                                 |
| grace_period_trial  | The customer was in a trial period and has now entered a grace period after failing to renew successfully.                                 |
| expired             | The customer's subscription has expired.                                                                                                   |

| paused              | The customer has a paid subscription which has been paused and is set to resume at some future date.                                       |

For customers with multiple active subscriptions, this attribute will represent the status of only the subscription for which the most recent event occurred.

Please note that since this attribute is set and updated when events are delivered, subscribers with events prior to our release of this attribute (during November 2023) will not have this attribute set until/unless a future event (renewal, cancellation, etc) occurs.
