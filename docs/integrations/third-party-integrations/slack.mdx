## Configure Slack Workspace

Before RevenueCat can post to your Slack channel, you need to authorize a webhook to post to your workspace. Slack has a more [detailed article](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115005265063-Incoming-WebHooks-for-Slack) on their website explaining how to set this up if you have trouble.

### 1. Create a **Slack app**

- Navigate to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) and create a new app. Give it a name like "RevenueCat" and select your workspace.

### 2. Enable **Incoming Webhooks** from the settings page
