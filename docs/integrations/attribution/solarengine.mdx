excerpt: Integrate Purchases SDK with Solar Engine for precise revenue tracking
hidden: false
---

With our Solar Engine integration you can:

- Attribute subscription revenue and lifecycle events to the campaigns that drove them.
- Stream trial conversions, renewals, cancellations, and more directly from RevenueCat without relying on an app in the foreground.
- Continue measuring long-tail revenue from each campaign as subscriptions renew over time.

### Integration at a Glance

| Includes Revenue | Supports Negative Revenue | Sends Sandbox Events | Includes Customer Attributes | Sends Transfer Events |                                                                 Optional Event Types                                                                 |
| :--------------: | :-----------------------: | :------------------: | :--------------------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        ✅        |            ✅             |          ✅          | Standard Reserved Attributes |          ❌           | `non_subscription_purchase_event` `uncancellation_event` `subscription_paused_event` `expiration_event` `billing_issue_event` `product_change_event` |

## 1. Install the Solar Engine SDK

Set up the latest Solar Engine SDK in every platform where you collect purchases before enabling the integration. Refer to the [Solar Engine developer documentation](https://help.solar-engine.com/en/docs/API-Integration-Documentation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.

## 2. Send device data to RevenueCat

Solar Engine matches RevenueCat events to campaign cohorts using device and advertising identifiers. Make sure your app collects and sends the following [Customer Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes) to RevenueCat before the first purchase occurs:

| Key        | Description                                                                                                                                     | Recommended Platforms |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `$idfa`    | iOS [advertising identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/1614151-advertisingidentifier) UUID        | iOS                   |
| `$idfv`    | iOS [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor) UUID                              | iOS                   |
| `$gpsAdId` | Google [advertising identifier](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info) | Android               |
| `$ip`      | Device IP address, gathered server-side when enabled                                                                                            | iOS & Android         |

These identifiers can be set manually like any other attribute, or by calling `collectDeviceIdentifiers()` after configuring the _Purchases SDK_. Call it again if a user later grants Ads Tracking permission so the `$idfa` value is updated.

Solar Engine also uses specific identifiers to associate lifecycle events with campaign cohorts. Use the Purchases SDK helpers to forward these identifiers to RevenueCat:

- `setSolarEngineDistinctId()` - The Solar Engine Distinct ID (primary identifier)
- `setSolarEngineAccountId()` - The Solar Engine Account ID (optional)
- `setSolarEngineVisitorId()` - The Solar Engine Visitor ID (optional)

## 3. Configure Solar Engine in the RevenueCat dashboard

After your SDK is ready and device data is flowing, finish the setup in RevenueCat:

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose **Solar Engine** from the Integrations menu.

2. Enter your **iOS App Key** and/or **Android App Key**. These keys authenticate requests from RevenueCat to Solar Engine. You can find them in your Solar Engine dashboard under Attribution > App > Edit App.

3. If your app targets users in China mainland, enable the **Use China Mainland Storage Region** option to ensure data is stored in the appropriate region.

4. Provide event names for each lifecycle event RevenueCat will send, or choose **Use default event names** to populate the recommended mapping:

   | RevenueCat lifecycle event | Default Solar Engine event name | Required |
   | :------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------- |
   | Initial purchase           | `initial_purchase_event`        | ✅       |
   | Trial started              | `trial_started_event`           | ✅       |
   | Trial converted            | `trial_converted_event`         | ✅       |
   | Trial cancelled            | `trial_cancelled_event`         | ✅       |
   | Renewal                    | `renewal_event`                 | ✅       |
   | Cancellation               | `cancellation_event`            | ✅       |
   | Non-renewing purchase      | `non_renewing_purchase_event`   | Optional |
   | Uncancellation             | `uncancellation_event`          | Optional |
   | Subscription paused        | `subscription_paused_event`     | Optional |
   | Expiration                 | `expiration_event`              | Optional |
   | Billing issue              | `billing_issue_event`           | Optional |
   | Product change             | `product_change_event`          | Optional |

   Customize any names to match the event definitions you have configured inside Solar Engine.

5. Select how RevenueCat should report revenue totals using the **Revenue reporting mode** menu:
   - `Gross` reports transaction amounts before app store commission and taxes.
   - `Net` reports revenue after estimated store commission and/or taxes.

6. Click **Add integration** (or **Save**) to enable the connection.

## 4. Test the Solar Engine integration

Before rolling out the integration, run through an end-to-end test:

1. Make a sandbox purchase with a new user after confirming the device identifiers from step 2 are present.
2. Visit the [Customer View](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile) for the tester and confirm the Solar Engine attributes are listed.
3. Open the test transaction in Customer History and ensure a Solar Engine event was delivered successfully. You can also review the **Last dispatched events** panel in the integration settings for a delivery log.

:::success You're all set!
Once configured, you should begin to see RevenueCat lifecycle events appear in Solar Engine aligned with the campaigns that sourced those users.
