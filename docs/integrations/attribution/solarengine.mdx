excerpt: Integrate Purchases SDK with Solar Engine for precise revenue tracking
hidden: false
---

With our Solar Engine integration you can:

- Attribute subscription revenue and lifecycle events to the campaigns that drove them.
- Stream trial conversions, renewals, cancellations, and more directly from RevenueCat without relying on an app in the foreground.
- Continue measuring long-tail revenue from each campaign as subscriptions renew over time.

### Integration at a Glance

| Includes Revenue | Supports Negative Revenue | Sends Sandbox Events | Includes Customer Attributes | Sends Transfer Events |                                                                 Optional Event Types                                                                 |
| :--------------: | :-----------------------: | :------------------: | :--------------------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|        ✅        |            ✅             |          ✅          | Standard Reserved Attributes |          ❌           | `non_subscription_purchase_event` `uncancellation_event` `subscription_paused_event` `expiration_event` `billing_issue_event` `product_change_event` |

## 1. Install the Solar Engine SDK

Set up the latest Solar Engine SDK in every platform where you collect purchases before enabling the integration. Refer to the [Solar Engine developer documentation](https://help.solar-engine.com/en/docs/API-Integration-Documentation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.

## 2. Send device data to RevenueCat

Solar Engine matches RevenueCat events to campaign cohorts using device and advertising identifiers. No subscriber attributes are strictly required for events to be sent. The following [Customer Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes) are recommended for accurate attribution:

| Key                      | Description                                                                                                                                     | Required         |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| `$solarEngineDistinctId` | Solar Engine Distinct Id. The primary Solar Engine identifier for the device                                                                    | ✅               |
| `$solarEngineAccountId`  | Solar Engine Account Id                                                                                                                         | ❌ (recommended) |
| `$solarEngineVisitorId`  | Solar Engine Visitor Id                                                                                                                         | ❌ (optional)    |
| `$idfa`                  | iOS [advertising identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/adsupport/asidentifiermanager/1614151-advertisingidentifier) UUID        | ❌ (recommended) |
| `$gpsAdId`               | Google [advertising identifier](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/identifier/AdvertisingIdClient.Info) | ❌ (recommended) |
| `$idfv`                  | iOS [vendor identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor) UUID                              | ❌ (recommended) |
| `$ip`                    | The IP address of the device                                                                                                                    | ❌ (recommended) |

These properties can be set manually, like any other [Customer Attributes](/customers/customer-attributes), or through the helper methods `collectDeviceIdentifiers()` and the Solar Engine setter methods.

import swiftContent from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/solarengine_1.swift?raw";
import kotlinContent from "@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/solarengine_2.kt?raw";

<RCCodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { type: "swift", content: swiftContent, name: "Swift" },
    { type: "kotlin", content: kotlinContent, name: "Kotlin" },
  ]}
/>

You should make sure to call `collectDeviceIdentifiers()` after the _Purchases SDK_ is configured, and before the first purchase occurs. It's safe to call this multiple times, as only the new/updated values will be sent to RevenueCat.

:::danger Device identifiers with iOS App Tracking Transparency (iOS 14.5+)
If you are requesting the App Tracking permission through ATT to access the IDFA, you can call `.collectDeviceIdentifiers()` _again_ if the customer accepts the permission to update the `$idfa` attribute in RevenueCat.
:::

:::info Import AdSupport Framework (iOS)
The AdSupport framework is required to access the IDFA parameter on iOS. Don't forget to import this into your project.
:::

![Import AdSupport Framework](/docs_images/integrations/attribution/import-adsupport-framework.png)

:::danger Remove any client-side purchase tracking
Make sure to remove all client-side tracking of revenue. Since RevenueCat will be sending events for all revenue actions, tracking purchases with the Solar Engine SDK directly can lead to double counting of revenue in Solar Engine.

## 3. Configure Solar Engine in the RevenueCat dashboard

After your SDK is ready and device data is flowing, finish the setup in RevenueCat:

1. Navigate to your project settings in the RevenueCat dashboard and choose **Solar Engine** from the Integrations menu.

![](/docs_images/integrations/attribution/solarengine/solarengine-configuration.png)

2. Enter your **iOS App Key** and/or **Android App Key**. These keys authenticate requests from RevenueCat to Solar Engine. You can find them in your Solar Engine dashboard under Attribution > App > Edit App.

![](/docs_images/integrations/attribution/solarengine/solarengine-app-key.png)

3. If your app targets users in China mainland, enable the **Use China Mainland Storage Region** option to ensure data is stored in the appropriate region.

4. Provide event names for each lifecycle event RevenueCat will send, or choose **Use default event names** to populate the recommended mapping:

   | RevenueCat lifecycle event | Default Solar Engine event name | Event Type                      | Required |
   | :------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------- |
   | Initial purchase           | `initial_purchase_event`        | In-App Purchase + rc_event_name | ✅       |
   | Trial started              | `trial_started_event`           | Custom event                    | ✅       |
   | Trial converted            | `trial_converted_event`         | In-App Purchase + rc_event_name | ✅       |
   | Trial cancelled            | `trial_cancelled_event`         | Custom event                    | ✅       |
   | Renewal                    | `renewal_event`                 | In-App Purchase + rc_event_name | ✅       |
   | Cancellation               | `cancellation_event`            | Custom event                    | ✅       |
   | Non-renewing purchase      | `non_renewing_purchase_event`   | In-App Purchase + rc_event_name | Optional |
   | Uncancellation             | `uncancellation_event`          | Custom event                    | Optional |
   | Subscription paused        | `subscription_paused_event`     | Custom event                    | Optional |
   | Expiration                 | `expiration_event`              | Custom event                    | Optional |
   | Billing issue              | `billing_issue_event`           | Custom event                    | Optional |
   | Product change             | `product_change_event`          | Custom event                    | Optional |

5. Select how RevenueCat should report revenue totals using the **Revenue reporting mode** menu:
   - `Gross` reports transaction amounts before app store commission and taxes.
   - `Net` reports revenue after estimated store commission and/or taxes.

6. Click **Add integration** (or **Save**) to enable the connection.

## 4. Test the Solar Engine integration

Before rolling out the integration, run through an end-to-end test:

1. Make a sandbox purchase with a new user after confirming the device identifiers from step 2 are present.
2. Visit the [Customer View](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-profile) for the tester and confirm the Solar Engine attributes are listed.
3. Open the test transaction in Customer History and ensure a Solar Engine event was delivered successfully. You can also review the **Last dispatched events** panel in the integration settings for a delivery log.

:::success You're all set!
Once configured, you should begin to see RevenueCat lifecycle events appear in Solar Engine aligned with the campaigns that sourced those users.
