## 1. Send attribution data to RevenueCat

The SplitMetrics Acquire integration requires that Apple Search Ads attribution data is sent from the device to RevenueCat. 

The simplest way to collect this information is by calling `enableAdServicesAttributionTokenCollection` **after** configuring the _Purchases SDK_.

import swiftContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads_1.swift"; 
import objectiveCContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads_2.m"; 
import flutterContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads_3.dart"; 
import reactNativeContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads_4.js"; 
import cordovaContent from "!!raw-loader!@site/code_blocks/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads_5.js";

<RCCodeBlock tabs={[ { type: 'swift', content: swiftContent }, { type: 'objc', content: objectiveCContent }, { type: 'flutter', content: flutterContent }, { type: 'rn', content: reactNativeContent }, { type: 'cordova', content: cordovaContent } ]} />

Our guide on [Apple Search Ads attribution](/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads) outlines this step in more detail.

## 2. Enable the Apple Search Ads Integration

Please ensure you've enabled the [Basic](/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads#basic) or [Advanced](/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads#advanced) Apple Search Ads integration in the RevenueCat dashboard.

## 3. Send RevenueCat events into SplitMetrics Acquire

After you've set up the _Purchases SDK_ to send device data to RevenueCat, you can "turn on" the integration and configure the event names from the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Navigate to your project in the RevenueCat dashboard and find the _Integrations_ card in the left menu. Select **+ New**

2. Choose **SplitMetrics Acquire** from the Integrations menu.
3. Add your SplitMetrics Acquire Client ID.
4. Enter the event names that RevenueCat will send or choose the default event names.
5. Select whether you want sales reported as gross revenue (before app store commission), or after store commission and/or estimated taxes.

:::danger Remove any client-side purchase tracking
Make sure to remove all client-side tracking of revenue. Since RevenueCat will be sending events for all revenue actions, tracking purchases yourself directly into SplitMetrics Acquire | Formerly SearchAdsHQ can lead to double counting of revenue.

## 4. Testing the SplitMetrics Acquire integration

You can test the SplitMetrics Acquire integration end-to-end before going live. It's recommended that you test the integration is working properly for new users, and any existing users that may update their app to a new version.

### Make a sandbox purchase with a new user

Simulate a new user installing your app, and go through your app flow to complete a sandbox purchase.

### Check that the required device data is collected

Navigate the the [Customer View](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history/basic-information) for the test user that just made a purchase. If you chose to send the additional data from step 1 above, check it is listed as an attribute for the user.

### Check that the SplitMetrics Acquire event delivered successfully

While still on the Customer View, click into the test purchase event in the [Customer History](/dashboard-and-metrics/customer-history) and make sure that the SplitMetrics Acquire integration event exists and was delivered successfully.
