## Version 3 Change Log

### Expiration fields

- `grace_period_end_time` allows you to distinguish between a subscriber's expected renewal date (`end_time`), and their new expiration date if they've been granted a grace period
- `effective_end_time` represents the date a subscriber will lose access to their entitlement if a successful payment does not occur. It is the latest value of `end_time` and `grace_period_end_time`.
  - This field should be used to represent a subscriber's expiration date when modeling common RevenueCat measures like Active Subscriptions.

### Taxes, commission, and proceeds estimation

- `tax_percentage` represents the estimated portion of a transaction's total revenue that will be deducted from the purchasing store due to taxes. To learn more about RevenueCat's tax estimations, [click here](/dashboard-and-metrics/taxes-and-commissions).
- `commission_percentage` represents the portion of a transaction's total revenue that will be deducted from the purchasing store due to their commissions and fees.
  - `commission_percentage` may differ from the rate expected from the store (e.g. 30%) in cases where taxes are deducted by the store before commission is applied.

### Ownership type

- `ownership_type` can be used to distinguish between transactions that originated from family sharing and those that did not. RevenueCat excludes family sharing transactions from our measures in Charts.

| `commission_percentage`\*        |             | The portion of a transaction’s price that will be detected by the store for commission.
