## Version 4 Change Log

### Data format improvements

:::warning
Please ensure that your data ingestion pipeline is setup to handle these format changes before updating to Version 4.
:::

- Boolean fields such as `is_trial_conversion` have previously been provided with the strings `t` and `f` to represent true and false, but they will now be delivered as true boolean fields with `true` or `false` as the set values.
- Fields containing arrays or JSON objects (`reserved_subscriber_attributes`, `custom_subscriber_attributes`, and `entitlement_identifiers`) will have the values within each key/value pair enclosed in quotes to prevent issues when ingesting the data.
- Last, for standardization, fields containing arrays (only `entitlement_identifiers`) have also been updated to contain the array within square brackets (`[` and `]`) instead of curly brackets (`{` and `}`). Fields containing JSON objects (`reserved_subscriber_attributes` and `custom_subscriber_attributes`) will continue to use curly brackets

:::info
The data table below contains sample values for each field to help ensure your pipeline is setup correctly.

## Newly added fields

### Measuring gross revenue

When a transaction is refunded, the current `price_in_usd` and `price_in_purchased_currency` fields will be set to `0` while `refunded_at` is set to mark the time of the refund.

To instead equip you to measure gross revenue before refunds, we've introduced new `purchase_price_in_usd` and `purchase_price_in_purchased_currency` fields which will remain set at the original purchase price even after a refund.

By sourcing your analysis' with these fields, you'll be able to measure gross revenue before refunds.

### Country fields

`country` has been updated to equal the store country of a given transaction when it is known, and to fall back to an IP-based estimated country when it is not known.

- The store country of a transaction is the most accurate way to group a subscription by country because it dictates the price of the subscription, the available offers, how price changes will be handled, etc.
- Update to iOS SDK version 3.14 and up to ensure store country can be captured by RevenueCat.

`country_source` has been added to distinguish between `country` values that represent the store country of a transaction (`from_sdk`), and those that have been set through an IP-based estimate (`estimated`).

### Product dimensions

`product_duration` represents the standard duration of a subscription product, set using ISO 8601 values (e.g. `P1M` for a 1 month subscription, `P1Y` for a 1 year subscription, etc).

- Trial period or introductory period lengths are not reported through this field. Therefore, when either `is_trial_period` or `is_in_intro_offer_period` are `true`, the `product_duration` does not represent the duration of that specific transaction. It represents the standard duration of the underlying product that has been subscribed to.
- There may be products where RevenueCat does not authoritatively know the standard duration, such as Stripe products which may have multiple prices (and therefore durations) associated with them. In these cases, `product_duration` will be null.
  - In our data features, we handle these cases by estimating product duration.

`product_display_name` represents the display name that may be set for a product in the RevenueCat Dashboard.

- Setting a display name may be especially useful for products on stores like Stripe where the `product_identifier` is not easily interpretable.

### Experiment fields

`experiment_id` represents the UUID of a RevenueCat Experiment that the associated App User ID was enrolled in.

`experiment_variant` represents the variant of the experiment that the associated App User ID was assigned to.

:::success Pro Integration
Experiments is available on the [Pro](https://www.revenuecat.com/pricing) plan. Get started with Experiments [here](/experiments-v1).
:::

### Change tracking

`updated_at` represents the last time an attribute of the transaction was modified (e.g. after a subscriber disables their auto-renewal and a `cancellation_date` is set). This can be used to more easily capture changes to individual transactions between exports.
