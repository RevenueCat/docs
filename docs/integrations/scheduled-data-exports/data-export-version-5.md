Scheduled data exports are available to all users signed up after September '23, the legacy Grow and Pro plans, and Enterprise plans.

## Version 5 Change Log

### Newly added fields

#### Measuring Offer usage

We've added `offer` and `offer_type` so that you can measure the performance of your Offers at your desired level of specificity. To learn more about how Offers are tracked, [click here](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts#understanding-offers).

#### First seen time

We've added `first_seen_time` so that you can cohort subscribers by the date they were first seen by RevenueCat. All of RevenueCat's Conversion Rate and Lifetime Value charts use this cohorting definition so you can measure the performance of cohorts of new customers over time.

### Auto resume time

In addition, we've added `auto_resume_time` so that you can track when a paused Play Store subscription will be resumed.

## Updating to Version 5

If you're on an older version of our exports, updating is easy -- [click here](/integrations/scheduled-data-exports#updating-to-the-latest-version) for a walkthrough.
