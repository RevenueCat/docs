### Organizations / Enterprise

We recommend using a company account when registering for RevenueCat and setting up your app within a project. You'll be able to invite the rest of your team as [collaborators](/welcome/projects/collaborators) to your project, but **only the project owner can manage billing**. Project collaborators can't manage billing details.

## Invite your team

Collaborators allow you to give team members controlled access to your RevenueCat Project.

Read more about collaborators and permissions in our [Invite your team](/welcome/projects/collaborators) guide.

## Done with this setup?

If you've configured your project in the dashboard, it's time to install the SDK to start making purchases.
