RevenueCat enables existing subscription businesses to offload and replace their entire subscription infrastructure, or use any number of RevenueCat features alongside their existing code. RevenueCat provides a powerful backend for validating purchases from the app stores and maintains a rich purchase history and subscriptions state for the customer. Use that power to increase engineering productivity and unlock new growth opportunities.
