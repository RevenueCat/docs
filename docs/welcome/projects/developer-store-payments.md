## How do you receive your revenue from purchases?

As RevenueCat is not the payment processor when your customers make a purchase, you will receive the revenue generated from the purchases from the app stores themselves, and thus, you will need to provide them with banking information when configuring your app in their developer portals. The app stores (Apple, Google, Amazon, Stripe) will take a portion of the revenue as payment for their services before sending your portion of the revenue to your account. Depending on the store and the country where you are based, different rules may be applied to your revenue.
