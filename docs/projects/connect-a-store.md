Each [project](/projects/overview) comes with a Test Store, where you can test your Products, Paywalls and Entitlements.

Before you can submit your app to an app store, you'll need to connect it to the stores and payment providers you want to support and set up [Server Notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications). After you've connected your app, you can import your products from the stores to start configuring your offerings.

Add an **app config** or **web config** in the _Apps & providers_ section of your app settings.

## Add a Configuration

RevenueCat supports a wide range of stores and payment providers.

### App Configuration

#### Apple App Store

To connect your app to the Apple App Store, you'll need to add your **App name**, **Bundle ID**, **Shared Secret**, and **In-App Purchase Key**.

- [Where do I find my shared secret?](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret)
- [Where do I find my in-app purchase key?](/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration)

We also recommend adding your **App Store Connect API Key** to your project, which will let you fetch your app's products from App Store Connect directly.

#### Google Play Store

To connect your app to the Google Play Store, you'll need to add your **App name**, **Package Name**, and **Service Credentials**.

- [Where do I find my service credentials?](/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials)

#### Amazon Appstore

To connect your app to the Amazon Appstore, you'll need to add your **App name**, **Package Name**, and **Shared Secret**.

### Web Configuration

## Platform Server Notifications

After adding your configurations, we recommend setting up [Platform Server Notifications](/platform-resources/server-notifications). These notifications will ensure RevenueCat is notified of purchases and subscription events as soon as possible, and will speed up [webhooks](/integrations/webhooks) and integration delivery times.

## Import Products

After adding your configurations, you can import your products from the stores to start configuring your offerings.

## Next steps

If you've added your configurations, it's time to install the SDK to start making purchases.
