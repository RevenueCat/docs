A RevenueCat project is the top-level entity for RevenueCat - it's like a container for your apps, products, and entitlements. Once you've created a project and added your apps, you can implement the RevenueCat SDK in your app to start making purchases.

Within a project, you can also configure integrations like [Webhooks](/integrations/webhooks), run [Experiments](/tools/experiments-v1), and create remotely configurable [Paywalls](/tools/paywalls).

## Creating a Project

To create a Project, click the **'+ Create new project'** button in the Projects dropdown panel at the top of the RevenueCat dashboard.

You can customize your project by setting a name as well as your global [restore behavior](/getting-started/restoring-purchases) for the apps in your Project.

## Project Settings

### General Settings

- **Project Name**: The name of your project.
- **Project ID**: The unique identifier for your project, used in the v2 API.
- **Restore Behavior**: The behavior of the SDK when a user restores their purchases. [Learn more](/projects/restore-behavior).

### Transferring Ownership

<details>
<summary>Transferring between RevenueCat accounts</summary>

To transfer specific projects from one account to another, [contact RevenueCat support](https://app.revenuecat.com/settings/support) for assistance. At this time only entire projects can be transferred, this cannot be done on an app-level.

- If the project in question has a Stripe app, you will need to make sure that the receiver has their [Stripe account connected](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/connect-stripe-account) to this project before transfer.
- If the project uses [Apple Search Ads](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/integrations/attribution/apple-search-ads#1-configure-integration) then this will need to be reconfigured after the transfer.

<summary>Transferring apps between App Store Connect and Google Developer accounts</summary>

If you are changing the App Store Connect or Google Developer account, this will require credentials to be regenerated for both.

- For Apple, these are the [app-specific shared secret](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret), the [in-app purchase key](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/in-app-purchase-key-configuration), and the [App Store Connect API key](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/itunesconnect-app-specific-shared-secret/app-store-connect-api-key-configuration). The new owner will also want to make sure their Paid Applications Agreement is signed with Apple.

- For Google, these are the [service credentials](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials). To reduce any downtime, we recommend the new owner generate these credentials in advance and test them on a RevenueCat project to make sure they are validated and working before the transfer.
