# Freemium Paywalls

This guide walks you through implementing a freemium monetization strategy using RevenueCat. In a freemium model, users can access basic features for free while premium features require a purchase.

## Overview

A freemium strategy provides value to users before asking them to pay, which can lead to:

- Higher user acquisition
- Better user engagement
- More organic growth through word-of-mouth
- Increased willingness to pay for premium features

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Plan Your Feature Tiers

1. Define free features:

   - Core functionality
   - Basic features that showcase value
   - Features that encourage engagement

2. Define premium features:
   - Advanced functionality
   - Enhanced user experience
   - Exclusive content or capabilities

### 2. Configure Products and Entitlements

1. Set up your products in the App Store/Play Store
2. Configure in RevenueCat:
   ```swift
   // Example entitlement mapping
   "free_tier": [
     // No products needed
   ],
   "premium_tier": [
     "monthly_premium",
     "annual_premium"
   ]
   ```

### 3. Implement Feature Gating

```swift
// iOS Example
class FeatureGate {
    static func checkPremiumAccess(completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) {
        Purchases.shared.getCustomerInfo { customerInfo, error in
            let hasPremiumAccess = customerInfo?.entitlements["premium"]?.isActive == true
            completion(hasPremiumAccess)
        }
    }

    static func showUpgradePrompt() {
        Purchases.shared.getOfferings { offerings, error in
            if let offering = offerings?.current {
                // Present your premium upgrade UI
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Android Example
class FeatureGate {
    fun checkPremiumAccess(completion: (Boolean) -> Unit) {
        Purchases.sharedInstance.getCustomerInfo { customerInfo ->
            val hasPremiumAccess = customerInfo.entitlements["premium"]?.isActive == true
            completion(hasPremiumAccess)
        }
    }

    fun showUpgradePrompt() {
        Purchases.sharedInstance.getOfferings { offerings ->
            offerings.current?.let { offering ->
                // Present your premium upgrade UI
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Implement Premium Feature UI

```swift
// iOS Example
func showFeature() {
    FeatureGate.checkPremiumAccess { isPremium in
        if isPremium {
            // Show premium feature
        } else {
            // Show feature preview with upgrade prompt
            FeatureGate.showUpgradePrompt()
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// Android Example
fun showFeature() {
    checkPremiumAccess { isPremium ->
        if (isPremium) {
            // Show premium feature
        } else {
            // Show feature preview with upgrade prompt
            showUpgradePrompt()
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Free Tier Value**

   - Provide genuine value in the free tier
   - Make core functionality accessible
   - Don't cripple the free experience

2. **Premium Feature Selection**

   - Choose premium features that offer clear additional value
   - Focus on features power users want
   - Consider different types of premium value:
     - Enhanced functionality
     - Removed limitations
     - Exclusive content
     - Better user experience

3. **Conversion Strategy**

   - Show premium value through previews
   - Use contextual upgrade prompts
   - Implement progressive onboarding

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear distinction between free and premium features
   - Smooth upgrade flow
   - Easy access to subscription management

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Poor Free Experience**

   - Don't make the free tier unusable
   - Avoid excessive limitations
   - Don't spam users with upgrade prompts

2. **Unclear Premium Value**

   - Don't hide premium features completely
   - Provide clear feature comparisons
   - Show premium value through previews

3. **Conversion Barriers**

   - Don't make upgrading difficult
   - Avoid complex pricing structures
   - Provide easy restoration of purchases

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Don't cache premium status indefinitely
   - Handle offline scenarios
   - Implement proper purchase restoration

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics in RevenueCat:

- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Time to conversion
- Premium feature usage
- User engagement patterns
- Retention rates by tier

Use RevenueCat's tools to:

- Monitor conversion funnels
- Track feature usage
- Analyze user behavior
- Optimize pricing

## Next Steps

1. Review the [RevenueCat SDK documentation](/getting-started/quickstart)
2. Set up [analytics](/dashboard-and-metrics/charts) to track conversions
3. Consider implementing [A/B testing](/tools/experiments-v1) for:
   - Feature sets
   - Pricing options
   - Upgrade prompts
4. Monitor [customer feedback](/dashboard-and-metrics/supporting-your-customers) to optimize your tiers
