This guide walks through implementing and optimizing a Freemium strategy using RevenueCat, focusing on how to manage entitlements, display upgrade prompts, and convert free users into paying customers with minimal friction.

## When to use

A freemium strategy provides value to users before asking them to pay. This model works well when:

- Offer a clear and compelling upgrade path from free to paid (e.g., feature gating, usage limits)
- Have low marginal costs per user (minimal server or infrastructure overhead)
- Leverage freemium users as growth drivers through sharing, referrals, or collaboration
- Face competitive pressure where users expect to try the core experience before subscribing

## Before you start

### 1. Define free features

- Core functionality
- Basic features that showcase value
- Features that encourage engagement

### 2. Define premium features

- Advanced functionality
- Enhanced user experience
- Exclusive content or capabilities

## Subscription Configuration Steps

Decide how many access tiers to offer based on your app's functionality and monetization goal.

### 1. Entitlements

For more information on how to set this up, please refer to our [entitlement setup documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements).

## Building your Paywall

Now that you have everything set up, it's time to build your paywall. Take advantage of [RevenueCat's Paywalls](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls-v2) and start creating your own.

## Presenting your Paywall

### Implementation

For Freemium Paywalls, you should not block the user from accessing free content. Instead, use paywalls as contextual prompts that users can dismiss. Below you can find some code snippets on how to accomplish this. Please refer to [this document](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls/displaying-paywalls) to get more detailed information on how to present paywalls.

import swiftui from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.swift?raw";
import kotlin from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_1.kt?raw";
import react from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_rn_1.ts.txt?raw";
import flutter from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_flutter_1.dart?raw";
import kmp from "@site/code_blocks/tools/paywalls_kmp_1.kts?raw";

## Best Practices

1. **Free Tier Value**

   - Provide genuine value in the free tier
   - Make core functionality accessible

2. **Premium Feature Selection**

   - Choose premium features that offer clear additional value
   - Consider different types of premium value:
     - Enhanced functionality
     - Removed limitations
     - Exclusive content
     - Better user experience

3. **User Experience**
   - Clear distinction between free and premium features
   - Smooth upgrade flow
   - Easy access to subscription management

## Test your Paywall

- Make sure your implementation works smoothly by testing across different user scenarios:
- Free features remain accessible at all times
- A paywall is shown when a premium feature is selected
- Premium features unlock immediately after purchase
- Restore purchases and error flows work as expected

Check on our [Testing Guide](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/guides/testing-guide/use-cases) to fine-tune your test cases and make sure everything is working as expected.
