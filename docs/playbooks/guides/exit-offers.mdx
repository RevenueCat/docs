This playbook illustrates how to configure and optimize an Exit Offer strategy, a powerful tool for recovering potentially lost conversions by presenting an alternative offer when a user dismisses your paywall.

## When to Use

An exit offer strategy is ideal when you want to give users a second chance to subscribe before they leave your paywall. This model works well when:

- You want to test different price points or trial lengths.
- You have a lower-priced or alternative tier that might better suit a user who is hesitant about your primary offering.
- You want to remind users of your app's value one last time before they navigate away.

## Subscription Configuration Steps

Configuring an exit offer requires setting up a dedicated, separate **Offering** that will be presented when the user dismisses the primary paywall.

### 1. Create an Exit Offer Entitlement (Optional)

If your exit offer unlocks a different set of features than your primary offering, you may want to create a separate [Entitlement](/getting-started/entitlements). However, in most cases, your exit offer will grant the same `pro` or `premium` entitlement.

### 2. Create Exit Offer Products

In the respective app stores, create the specific products for your exit offer. For example, if your primary offering is an annual plan, your exit offer product might be a discounted monthly plan or a plan with a 7-day trial.

For more information on how to set this up, please refer to our [product setup documentation](/offerings/products-overview).

### 3. Create the Exit Offering

This is the most critical step. You must create a new, separate **Offering** in RevenueCat that contains the exit offer products you created in the previous step. 

1.  Navigate to the **Product Catalog** section of your project.
2.  Create a new [Offering](/offerings/overview) (e.g., `exit_offer`).
3.  Add a **Package** to this new Offering that contains the discounted or alternative products for iOS, Android, and web.

This separation is what allows you to present a different set of products upon paywall dismissal.

## Building your Paywall

Once you have two separate Offerings (your primary one and your exit offer one), you need to create a paywall for each.

1.  **Primary Paywall:** Build or select the paywall associated with your primary Offering.
2.  **Exit Offer Paywall:** Build a second paywall associated with your new `exit_offer` Offering. This is the paywall that users will see when they try to close the primary one.

### Configure the Exit Offer

Now, link the two paywalls together:

1.  Open your **primary paywall** in the Paywall Editor.
2.  In the **Paywall settings** on the left, find the **Exit offer** section.
3.  From the **Paywall dismiss** dropdown, select the **Offering** for your exit offer (e.g., `exit_offer`).
4.  Save your changes.

No code changes are required to enable this feature. Once configured in the dashboard, the SDK will automatically handle presenting the exit offer paywall.

## Presenting your Paywall

Exit offers work automatically, but only when you use a supported presentation method that presents the paywall as a modal or full-screen view. 

### Supported Presentation Methods

| Platform | Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| iOS | `presentPaywall()` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded()` |
| Android | `PaywallDialog` or `PaywallActivity` classes |
| React Native | `presentPaywall()` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded()` |
| Flutter | `presentPaywall()` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded()` |
| Capacitor | `presentPaywall()` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded()` |
| Unity | `presentPaywall()` or `presentPaywallIfNeeded()` |

:::warning View-based APIs Not Supported
Exit offers will **not** work if you manually embed paywall views/components in your UI (e.g., `PaywallView`, `Paywall` composable, `<RevenueCatUI.Paywall>` component, etc). The feature relies on intercepting the dismissal of a presented view.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Minimum Version |
| :------------ | :-------------- |
| iOS | 5.52.0+ |
| Android | 9.18.0+ |
| React Native | 9.6.15+ |
| Flutter | 9.10.5+ |
| Capacitor | 12.0.3+ |
| Unity | 8.4.15+ |
| KMP | Not supported |

## Best Practices

1.  **Offer Real Value**
    -   Provide a genuine discount, a longer trial, or a different package that addresses potential user hesitation (e.g., offer a monthly plan if the main paywall pushed an annual one).

2.  **Keep it Simple**
    -   The exit offer paywall should be clear and concise. The user is already on their way out; make the new offer easy to understand and accept.

3.  **Don't Overuse**
    -   Exit offers should feel like a special, one-time opportunity, not a frustrating loop. Ensure the user can easily dismiss the exit offer paywall as well.

## Test your Paywall

-   Confirm that dismissing your primary paywall correctly presents the exit offer paywall.
-   Verify that the exit offer paywall displays the correct discounted products.
-   Ensure that dismissing the exit offer paywall successfully closes the entire paywall flow.
-   Test a purchase from the exit offer to confirm it grants the correct entitlement.

Review our [Testing Guide](/guides/testing-guide/use-cases) to fine-tune your test cases.

## Next Steps

1.  Use [Experiments](/tools/experiments-v1) to A/B test different exit offers to see which one performs best.
2.  Use [Targeting](/tools/targeting) to show different primary Offerings (with different exit offers) to different user segments.
