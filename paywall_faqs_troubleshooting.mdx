Paywall FAQs & Troubleshooting

1. "{Localization} has an error." message and paywall cannot be saved

If you cannot save your paywall and see this message, this means that there is a required piece of information that needs to be filled out. To resolve this go through each section and make sure all of the required information is filled out which will be denoted by a red outline and "This field is required." message.


2. Paywall does not auto-dismiss when restoring purchases

If using presentPaywall, this doesn’t dismiss on restoring purchases – it will only auto-dismiss on a successful purchase. Use presentPaywallIfNeeded or PaywallView with the onRestore listener for this behavior.


3. Consumables can't be repurchased 
In order for consumables to be repurchased with RevenueCat paywalls, the package type must be Custom or Lifetime.


4. Paywall v2 is showing the default paywall and not what was configured in the editor.

By default the editor is a draft so you need to make sure to publish the paywall when you have finished making changes.


5. Paywall v2 extends past the screen

If your image width is greater than the parent view this can occur. Make sure that it does not exceed it.
